abstract = {It is widely accepted that gene expression regulation is a stochastic event. The common approach for its computer simulation requires detailed information on the interactions of individual molecules, which is often not available for the analyses of biological experiments. As an alternative approach, we employed a more intuitive model to simulate the experimental result, the Markov-chain model, in which a gene is regulated by activators and repressors, which bind the same site in a mutually exclusive manner. Our stochastic simulation in the presence of both activators and repressors predicted a Hill-coefficient of the dose-response curve closer to the experimentally observed value than the calculated value based on the simple additive effects of activators alone and repressors alone. The simulation also reproduced the heterogeneity of gene expression levels among individual cells observed by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting analysis. Therefore, our approach may help to apply stochastic simulations to broader experimental data.},

abstract = {To understand how hormones and antihormones regulate transcription of estrogen-responsive genes, in vivo footprinting was used to examine the endogenous pS2 gene in MCF-7 cells. While the consensus pS2 estrogen response element (ERE) half site was protected in the absence of hormone, both the consensus and imperfect ERE half sites were protected in the presence of estrogen. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen and ICI 182,780 elicited distinct footprinting patterns, which differed from those observed with vehicle- or with estrogen-treated cells suggesting that the partial agonist/antagonist and antagonist properties of 4-hydroxytamoxifen or ICI 182,780, respectively, may be partially explained by modulation of protein-DNA interactions. Footprinting patterns in and around the TATA and CAAT sequences were identical in the presence and in the absence of estrogen suggesting that the basal promoter is accessible and poised for transcription even in the absence of hormone. In vitro DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrated that the estrogen receptor bound to the pS2 ERE and that adjacent nucleotides were protected by MCF-7 nuclear proteins. These findings indicate that transcription of the pS2 gene is modulated by alterations in protein binding to multiple sites upstream of the basal promoter, but not by changes in protein-DNA interactions in the basal promoter.},

abstract = {For gene regulation, some transcriptional activators bind periodically to promoters with either a fast (approximately 1 minute) or a slow (approximately 15 to 90 minutes) cycle. It is uncertain whether the fast cycle occurs on natural promoters, and the function of either cycle in transcription remains unclear. We report that fast and slow cycling can occur simultaneously on an endogenous yeast promoter and that slow cycling in this system reflects an oscillation in the fraction of accessible promoters rather than the recruitment and release of stably bound transcriptional activators. This observation, combined with single-cell measurements of messenger RNA (mRNA) production, argues that fast cycling initiates transcription and that slow cycling regulates the quantity of mRNA produced. These findings counter the prevailing view that slow cycling initiates transcription.},

We developed an interactive software tool for segmentation, tracking, and visualization of individual fibers. Open active contours are parametric curves that deform to minimize the sum of an external energy derived from the image and an internal bending and stretching energy. The external energy generates (i) forces that attract the contour toward the central bright line of a filament in the image, and (ii) forces that stretch the active contour toward the ends of bright ridges. Images of simulated semiflexible polymers with known bending and torsional rigidity are analyzed to validate the method. We apply our methods to quantify the conformations and dynamics of actin in two examples: actin filaments imaged by TIRF microscopy in vitro, and actin cables in fission yeast imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy.},

Yet, the challenge for biology overall is to understand how organisms function. By discovering how function arises in dynamic interactions, systems biology addresses the missing links between molecules and physiology. Top-down systems biology identifies molecular interaction networks on the basis of correlated molecular behavior observed in genome-wide "omics" studies. Bottom-up systems biology examines the mechanisms through which functional properties arise in the interactions of known components. Here, we outline the challenges faced by systems biology and discuss limitations of the top-down and bottom-up approaches, which, despite these limitations, have already led to the discovery of mechanisms and principles that underlie cell function.},

abstract = {Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have been found to express different numbers of molecules of specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and inactivation was developed to explain the statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that increasing the level of transcription factors increases the average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise questions about how cells are able to function in the face of such noise.},

To test our approach, we use time-resolved expression data of individual human cells and, from this information, predict the stationary cell-to-cell variation in protein levels in a clonal population. For three of the four human genes investigated, the cellular variations in expression level are not due to fluctuations in promoter activity or transcript copy number, but are almost exclusively a consequence of long-term variations of gene regulatory factors or the global cellular state. Moreover, we show that a dynamic description is much more reliable to discriminate extrinsic and intrinsic sources of noise than it is on grounds of cell-cycle averaged descriptions. The excellent agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimentally measured noise strengths shows that a quantitative description of gene expression noise is indeed possible on the basis of idealized stochastic processes.},

abstract = {Dynamic organization of the cell interior, which is crucial for cell function, largely depends on the microtubule cytoskeleton. Microtubules move and position organelles by pushing, pulling, or sliding. Pushing forces can be generated by microtubule polymerization, whereas pulling typically involves microtubule depolymerization or molecular motors, or both. Sliding between a microtubule and another microtubule, an organelle, or the cell cortex is also powered by molecular motors. Although numerous examples of microtubule-based pushing and pulling in living cells have been observed, it is not clear why different cell types and processes employ different mechanisms. This review introduces a classification of microtubule-based positioning strategies and discusses the efficacy of pushing and pulling. The positioning mechanisms based on microtubule pushing are efficient for movements over small distances, and for centering of organelles in symmetric geometries. Mechanisms based on pulling, on the other hand, are typically more elaborate, but are necessary when the distances to be covered by the organelles are large, and when the geometry is asymmetric and complex. Thus, taking into account cell geometry and the length scale of the movements helps to identify general principles of the intracellular layout based on microtubule forces.},

The setup can precisely ablate sub-micrometer structures, such as microtubules and mitotic spindles, inside living cells, which remain viable after the manipulation. Longer exposure times lead to ablation, while shorter exposures lead to photo-bleaching of the target structure. We used optical tweezers to trap intracellular particles and to displace the cell nucleus. Two-photon fluorescence imaging of the manipulated cell can be performed simultaneously with trapping. The combination of techniques described here may help to solve a variety of problems in cell biology, such as positioning of organelles and the forces exerted by the cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is now widely used to investigate binding interactions in live cells. Although various idealized solutions have been identified for the reaction-diffusion equations that govern FRAP, there has been no comprehensive analysis or systematic approach to serve as a guide for extracting binding information from an arbitrary FRAP curve. Here we present a complete solution to the FRAP reaction-diffusion equations for either single or multiple independent binding interactions, and then relate our solution to the various idealized cases. This yields a coherent approach to extract binding information from FRAP data which we have applied to the question of transcription factor mobility in the nucleus. We show that within the nucleus, the glucocorticoid receptor is transiently bound to a single state, with each molecule binding on average 65 sites per second. This rapid sampling is likely to be important in finding a specific promoter target sequence. Further we show that this predominant binding state is not the nuclear matrix, as some studies have suggested. We illustrate how our analysis provides several self-consistency checks on a FRAP fit. We also define constraints on what can be estimated from FRAP data, show that diffusion should play a key role in many FRAP recoveries, and provide tools to test its contribution. Overall our approach establishes a more general framework to assess the role of diffusion, the number of binding states, and the binding constants underlying a FRAP recovery.},

We show that the budding yeast gamma-tubulin (Tub4p) is phosphorylated in vivo. Hyperphosphorylated Tub4p isoforms are restricted to G1. A conserved tyrosine near the carboxy terminus (Tyr445) is required for phosphorylation in vivo. A point mutation, Tyr445 to Asp, causes cells to arrest prior to anaphase. The frequency of new microtubules appearing in the SPB region and the number of microtubules are increased in tub4-Y445D cells, suggesting this mutation promotes microtubule assembly. These data suggest that modification of gamma-tubulin is important for controlling microtubule number, thereby influencing microtubule organization and function during the yeast cell cycle.},

abstract = {A classic problem in population and evolutionary biology is to understand how a population optimizes its fitness in fluctuating environments. A population might enhance its fitness by allowing individual cells to stochastically transition among multiple phenotypes, thus ensuring that some cells are always prepared for an unforeseen environmental fluctuation. Here we experimentally explore how switching affects population growth by using the galactose utilization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a strain that randomly transitions between two phenotypes as a result of stochastic gene expression. Each phenotype was designed to confer a growth advantage over the other phenotype in a certain environment. When we compared the growth of two populations with different switching rates, we found that fast-switching populations outgrow slow switchers when the environment fluctuates rapidly, whereas slow-switching phenotypes outgrow fast switchers when the environment changes rarely. These results suggest that cells may tune inter-phenotype switching rates to the frequency of environmental changes.},

Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},

abstract = {In addition to the conventional myosins (class II) required for processes such as muscle contraction and cytokinesis, the myosin superfamily of actin-based motor proteins includes at least 14 'unconventional' classes. These unconventional myosins are defined by myosin-like head (motor) domains attached to class-specific tail domains that differ greatly from those of myosin-II. The unconventional myosins account for almost two-thirds of the 28 or more myosin genes currently believed to be expressed in humans and 80-90\% of the approximately 10 or more myosin genes expressed in a typical nonmuscle cell. Although these members of the myosin superfamily have not been as intensively investigated as the conventional myosins, unconventional myosins are known or believed to power many forms of actin-based motility and organelle trafficking. The presence of signaling domains such as kinase domains, SH3 domains, PH domains or GTPase-activating domains in the tails of unconventional myosins indicates that these proteins can also be components of signal transduction pathways. Since several classes of the myosin superfamily have been found only in lower eukaryotes or plants (VIII, XI, XIII and XIV), in this review we will focus on the structures and properties of the unconventional myosins found in multicellular animals (excluding classes I and V, which have been reviewed elsewhere recently). Special attention will be focused on the three classes of unconventional myosins that can cause deafness in mouse or humans when mutated. In addition, we discuss the discovery of a pair of intriguing domains, the Myosin Tail Homology 4 (MyTH4) and FERM (band 4.1, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) domains, that are present in the tails of otherwise very different myosins as well as a plant kinesin-like protein. Recent progress in the identification of novel unconventional myosins will also be summarized.},

abstract = {Conventional studies of steroid hormone action proceed via quantitation of the maximal activity for gene induction at saturating concentrations of agonist steroid (i.e., A(max)). Less frequently analyzed parameters of receptor-mediated gene expression are EC(50) and PAA. The EC(50) is the concentration of steroid required for half-maximal agonist activity and is readily determined from the dose-response curve. The PAA is the partial agonist activity of an antagonist steroid, expressed as percent of A(max) under the same conditions. Recent results demonstrate that new and otherwise inaccessible mechanistic information is obtained when the EC(50) and/or PAA are examined in addition to the A(max). Specifically, A(max), EC(50), and PAA can be independently regulated, which suggests that novel pathways and factors may preferentially modify the EC(50) and/or PAA with little effect on A(max). Other approaches indicate that the activity of receptor-bound factors can be altered without changing the binding of factors to receptor. Finally, a new theoretical model of steroid hormone action not only permits a mechanistically based definition of factor activity but also allows the positioning of when a factor acts, as opposed to binds, relative to a kinetically defined step. These advances illustrate some of the benefits of expanding the mechanistic studies of steroid hormone action to routinely include EC(50) and PAA.},

Nucleoli, chromosomes, centrioles, spindles, and nuclear envelopes were seen in living hyphae of both fungi. The entire division process occurred within an intact nuclear envelope. Spindles were produced between separating daughter centrioles. At metaphase the chromosomes became attached to the spindle at different points. In F. oxysporum the metaphase chromosomes were clear enough to allow counts to be made, and longitudinal splitting of the chromosomes into chromatids was observed. Anaphase was characterized in both fungi by separation of chromosomes to poles established by the centrioles, and in F. oxysporum anaphase separation of chromosomes was observed in vivo. Continued elongation of the spindles further separated the daughter nuclei. Maturing daughter nuclei of both fungi were quite motile; and in C. fagacearum the centriole preceded the bulk of the nucleus during migration.

abstract = {Many cellular processes require molecular motors to produce motion and forces. Single molecule experiments have led to a precise description of how a motor works. Under most physiological conditions, however, molecular motors operate in groups. Interactions between motors yield collective behaviors that cannot be explained only from single molecule properties. The aim of this paper is to review the various theoretical descriptions that explain the emergence of collective effects in molecular motor assemblies. These include bidirectional motion, hysteretic behavior, spontaneous oscillations, and self-organization into dynamical structures. We discuss motors acting on the cytoskeleton both in a prescribed geometry such as in muscles or flagella and in the cytoplasm.},

Thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that RNA polymerase (RNAP) is bound to the promoter of interest. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for computing these probabilities. Within this framework, interactions of activators, repressors, helper molecules and RNAP are described by a single function, the "regulation factor". This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell.},

abstract = {Computational techniques based on simulation have now become an essential part of the statistician's toolbox. It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer's point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here. This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis \{Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader. Christian P. Robert is Professor of Statistics at Universite Paris Dauphine, and Head of the Statistics Laboratory of CREST, both in Paris, France. He has authored more than 150 papers in applied probability, Bayesian statistics and simulation methods. He is a fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and the recipient of an IMS Medallion. He has authored eight other books, including The Bayesian Choice which received the ISBA DeGroot Prize in 2004, Monte Carlo Statistical Methods with George Casella, and Bayesian Core with Jean-Michel Marin. He has served as Joint Editor of the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, as well as an associate editor for most major statistical journals, and was the 2008 ISBA President. George Casella is Distinguished Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Florida. He is active in both theoretical and applied statistics, is a fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and the American Statistical Association, and a Foreign Member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences. He has served as Theory and Methods Editor of the Journal of the American Statistical Association, as Executive Editor of Statistical Science, and as Joint Editor of the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B. In addition to books with Christian Robert, he has written Variance Components, 1992, with S.R. Searle and C.E. McCulloch; Statistical Inference, Second Edition, 2001, with Roger Berger; and Theory of Point Estimation, Second Edition, 1998, with Erich Lehmann. His latest book is Statistical Design 2008.}},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics and variability of protein circuitry requires accurate measurements in living cells as well as theoretical models. To address this, we employed one of the best-studied protein circuits in human cells, the negative feedback loop between the tumor suppressor p53 and the oncogene Mdm2. We measured the dynamics of fluorescently tagged p53 and Mdm2 over several days in individual living cells. We found that isogenic cells in the same environment behaved in highly variable ways following DNA-damaging gamma irradiation: some cells showed undamped oscillations for at least 3 days (more than 10 peaks). The amplitude of the oscillations was much more variable than the period. Sister cells continued to oscillate in a correlated way after cell division, but lost correlation after about 11 h on average. Other cells showed low-frequency fluctuations that did not resemble oscillations. We also analyzed different families of mathematical models of the system, including a novel checkpoint mechanism. The models point to the possible source of the variability in the oscillations: low-frequency noise in protein production rates, rather than noise in other parameters such as degradation rates. This study provides a view of the extensive variability of the behavior of a protein circuit in living human cells, both from cell to cell and in the same cell over time.},

abstract = {Phytoestrogens are a chemically diverse group of compounds made by plants that can have estrogenic effects in animals. Both tumorigenic and antitumorigenic effects have been reported. Although estrogens stimulate the growth of many breast tumors, there is a negative correlation between the incidence of breast cancer and the phytoestrogen-rich diet of certain Asian populations. To begin to resolve this paradox, we have analyzed the estrogenic properties of genistein and quercetin, two flavonoid phytoestrogens particularly abundant in soybeans. Trans-activation experiments with a transfected reporter gene for nuclear estrogen receptors (ER) show strong activation of the endogenous ER[alpha] by both phytoestrogens in two MCF7 human breast cancer cell lines. This is supported by the observation that the two phytoestrogens induce the down-regulation of ER[alpha] mRNA and protein levels. Using chimeric proteins consisting of the hormone binding domains of ER[alpha] and ER[beta] fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, we have established that genistein and quercetin are full estrogenic agonists of both ER isoforms. Ligand binding experiments with purified ER[alpha] and ER[beta] confirm that the two phytoestrogens are ER ligands. At concentrations that are sufficient to obtain substantial transcriptional activity, they stimulate the proliferation of two ER[alpha]-dependent breast cancer cell lines. At high concentrations, such as those reached with a soy-rich diet, genistein and quercetin are strong cytotoxic agents that even kill ER-independent HeLa cells. Thus, the mode of action of phytoestrogens and the balance between being risk or chemopreventive factors for breast cancer may depend on the dietary load.

abstract = {Meiotic nuclear oscillations in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe are crucial for proper chromosome pairing and recombination. We report a mechanism of these oscillations on the basis of collective behavior of dynein motors linking the cell cortex and dynamic microtubules that extend from the spindle pole body in opposite directions. By combining quantitative live cell imaging and laser ablation with a theoretical description, we show that dynein dynamically redistributes in the cell in response to load forces, resulting in more dynein attached to the leading than to the trailing microtubules. The redistribution of motors introduces an asymmetry of motor forces pulling in opposite directions, leading to the generation of oscillations. Our work provides the first direct in vivo observation of self-organized dynamic dynein distributions, which, owing to the intrinsic motor properties, generate regular large-scale movements in the cell.},

abstract = {Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is generally associated with epigenetic silencing of transcription and is maintained through cellular division. Multiple CpG sequences are rare in mammalian genomes, but frequently occur at the transcriptional start site of active genes, with most clusters of CpGs being hypomethylated. We reported previously that the proximal region of the trefoil factor 1 (TFF1, also known as pS2) and oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) promoters could be partially methylated by treatment with deacetylase inhibitors, suggesting the possibility of dynamic changes in DNA methylation. Here we show that cyclical methylation and demethylation of CpG dinucleotides, with a periodicity of around 100 min, is characteristic for five selected promoters, including the oestrogen (E2)-responsive pS2 gene, in human cells. When the pS2 gene is actively transcribed, DNA methylation occurs after the cyclical occupancy of ERalpha and RNA polymerase II (polII). Moreover, we report conditions that provoke methylation cycling of the pS2 promoter in cell lines in which pS2 expression is quiescent and the proximal promoter is methylated. This coincides with a low-level re-expression of ERalpha and of pS2 transcripts.},

It is well established that growth affects cell division (reviewed in Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004). This review will focus on the reverse, less well-defined relationship-how cell cycle progression affects growth. We will summarize findings that indicate that growth is not constant during the cell cycle and discuss the surprising possibility that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) inhibit growth.},

@article{Harper:2011p7205,
abstract = {In individual mammalian cells the expression of some genes such as prolactin is highly variable over time and has been suggested to occur in stochastic pulses. To investigate the origins of this behavior and to understand its functional relevance, we quantitatively analyzed this variability using new mathematical tools that allowed us to reconstruct dynamic transcription rates of different reporter genes controlled by identical promoters in the same living cell. Quantitative microscopic analysis of two reporter genes, firefly luciferase and destabilized EGFP, was used to analyze the dynamics of prolactin promoter-directed gene expression in living individual clonal and primary pituitary cells over periods of up to 25 h. We quantified the time-dependence and cyclicity of the transcription pulses and estimated the length and variation of active and inactive transcription phases. We showed an average cycle period of approximately 11 h and demonstrated that while the measured time distribution of active phases agreed with commonly accepted models of transcription, the inactive phases were differently distributed and showed strong memory, with a refractory period of transcriptional inactivation close to 3 h. Cycles in transcription occurred at two distinct prolactin-promoter controlled reporter genes in the same individual clonal or primary cells. However, the timing of the cycles was independent and out-of-phase. For the first time, we have analyzed transcription dynamics from two equivalent loci in real-time in single cells. In unstimulated conditions, cells showed independent transcription dynamics at each locus. A key result from these analyses was the evidence for a minimum refractory period in the inactive-phase of transcription. The response to acute signals and the result of manipulation of histone acetylation was consistent with the hypothesis that this refractory period corresponded to a phase of chromatin remodeling which significantly increased the cyclicity. Stochastically timed bursts of transcription in an apparently random subset of cells in a tissue may thus produce an overall coordinated but heterogeneous phenotype capable of acute responses to stimuli.},

@article{McAdams1997,
abstract = {In cellular regulatory networks, genetic activity is controlled by molecular signals that determine when and how often a given gene is transcribed. In genetically controlled pathways, the protein product encoded by one gene often regulates expression of other genes. The time delay, after activation of the first promoter, to reach an effective level to control the next promoter depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation and translation termination in a single such "genetically coupled" link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene expression shows that proteins are produced from an activated promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large differences in the time between successive events in regulatory cascades across a cell population. In addition, the random pattern of expression of competitive effectors can produce probabilistic outcomes in switching mechanisms that select between alternative regulatory paths. The result can be a partitioning of the cell population into different phenotypes as the cells follow different paths. There are numerous unexplained examples of phenotypic variations in isogenic populations of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may be the result of these stochastic gene expression mechanisms.},

Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine - the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

@article{Lionnet2010,
abstract = {The internal workings of the nucleus remain a mystery. A list of component parts exists, and in many cases their functional roles are known for events such as transcription, RNA processing, or nuclear export. Some of these components exhibit structural features in the nucleus, regions of concentration or bodies that have given rise to the concept of functional compartmentalization--that there are underlying organizational principles to be described. In contrast, a picture is emerging in which transcription appears to drive the assembly of the functional components required for gene expression, drawing from pools of excess factors. Unifying this seemingly dual nature requires a more rigorous approach, one in which components are tracked in time and space and correlated with onset of specific nuclear functions. In this chapter, we anticipate tools that will address these questions and provide the missing kinetics of nuclear function. These tools are based on analyzing the fluctuations inherent in the weak signals of endogenous nuclear processes and determining values for them. In this way, it will be possible eventually to provide a computational model describing the functional relationships of essential components.},

@article{Adames2000,
abstract = {During mitosis in budding yeast the nucleus first moves to the mother-bud neck and then into the neck. Both movements depend on interactions of cytoplasmic microtubules with the cortex. We investigated the mechanism of these movements in living cells using video analysis of GFP-labeled microtubules in wild-type cells and in EB1 and Arp1 mutants, which are defective in the first and second steps, respectively. We found that nuclear movement to the neck is largely mediated by the capture of microtubule ends at one cortical region at the incipient bud site or bud tip, followed by microtubule depolymerization. Efficient microtubule interactions with the capture site require that microtubules be sufficiently long and dynamic to probe the cortex. In contrast, spindle movement into the neck is mediated by microtubule sliding along the bud cortex, which requires dynein and dynactin. Free microtubules can also slide along the cortex of both bud and mother. Capture/shrinkage of microtubule ends also contributes to nuclear movement into the neck and can serve as a backup mechanism to move the nucleus into the neck when microtubule sliding is impaired. Conversely, microtubule sliding can move the nucleus into the neck even when capture/shrinkage is impaired.},

abstract = {From molecules in cells to organisms in ecosystems, biological populations fluctuate due to the intrinsic randomness of individual events and the extrinsic influence of changing environments. The combined effect is often too complex for effective analysis, and many studies therefore make simplifying assumptions, for example ignoring either intrinsic or extrinsic effects to reduce the number of model assumptions. Here we mathematically demonstrate how two identical and independent reporters embedded in a shared fluctuating environment can be used to identify intrinsic and extrinsic noise terms, but also how these contributions are qualitatively and quantitatively different from what has been previously reported. Furthermore, we show for which classes of biological systems the noise contributions identified by dual-reporter methods correspond to the noise contributions predicted by correct stochastic models of either intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms. We find that for broad classes of systems, the extrinsic noise from the dual-reporter method can be rigorously analyzed using models that ignore intrinsic stochasticity. In contrast, the intrinsic noise can be rigorously analyzed using models that ignore extrinsic stochasticity only under very special conditions that rarely hold in biology. Testing whether the conditions are met is rarely possible and the dual-reporter method may thus produce flawed conclusions about the properties of the system, particularly about the intrinsic noise. Our results contribute toward establishing a rigorous framework to analyze dynamically fluctuating biological systems.},

abstract = {Different organisms employ a variety of strategies to segregate their chromosomes during mitosis. Despite these differences, however, the basic regulatory principles that govern this intricate process are evolutionarily conserved. Above all, rapid dephosphorylation of mitotic phosphoproteins upon the metaphase-to-anaphase transition has proven to be essential for proper function of the mitotic spindle and accurate chromosome segregation in all eukaryotes. Recently, a central midzone component, the microtubule crosslinker Ase1/PRC1 (anaphase spindle elongation 1/protein regulating cytokinesis 1), was uncovered as a universal target of such control mechanism. Depending on its phosphorylation status, Ase1 either restrains spindle elongation in metaphase or promotes it after anaphase onset via recruitment of kinesin motor proteins to the midzone. Here we discuss the potential role of Ase1/PRC1 as a central regulatory platform that interconnects distinct functions of the midzone such as spindle stability, spindle elongation and cytokinesis. Additionally, we provide a comparative overview of the chromosome segregation strategies used by the main model organisms.},

In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

abstract = {Cytoplasmic dynein mediates spindle orientation from the cell cortex through interactions with astral microtubules, but neither the mechanism governing its cortical targeting nor the regulation thereof is well understood. Here we show that yeast dynein offloads from microtubule plus ends to the daughter cell cortex. Mutants with an engineered peptide inserted between the tail domain and the motor head retain wild-type motor activity but exhibit enhanced offloading and cortical targeting. Conversely, shortening the "neck" sequence between the tail and motor domains precludes offloading from the microtubule plus ends. Furthermore, chimeric mutants with mammalian dynein "neck" sequences rescue targeting and function. These findings provide direct support for an active microtubule-mediated delivery process that appears to be regulated by a conserved masking/unmasking mechanism.},

Here, we describe a method of fluctuation analysis of fluorescently labeled RNA to measure dynamics of nascent RNA--including initiation, elongation, and termination--at an active yeast locus. We find no transcriptional memory between initiation events, and elongation speed can vary by threefold throughout the cell cycle. By measuring the abundance and intranuclear mobility of an upstream transcription factor, we observe that the gene firing rate is directly determined by trans-activating factor search times.},

Photobleaching and photoactivation of fluorescent MS2 proteins used to label nascent messenger RNAs provided sensitive elongation measurements. A mechanistic kinetic model that fits our data was validated using specific inhibitors. Polymerases elongated at 4.3 kilobases min(-1), much faster than previously documented, and entered a paused state for unexpectedly long times. Transcription onset was inefficient, with only 1\% of polymerase-gene interactions leading to completion of an mRNA.

@article{Zheng:2007p3046,
abstract = {Many organisms divide chromosomes within the confines of the nuclear envelope (NE) in a process known as closed mitosis. Thus, they must ensure coordination between segregation of the genetic material and division of the NE itself. Although many years of work have led to a reasonably clear understanding of mitotic spindle function in chromosome segregation, the NE division mechanism remains obscure. Here, we show that fission yeast cells overexpressing the transforming acid coiled coil (TACC)-related protein, Mia1p/Alp7p, failed to separate the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) at the onset of mitosis, but could assemble acentrosomal bipolar and antiparallel spindle structures. Most of these cells arrested in anaphase with fully extended spindles and nonsegregated chromosomes. Spindle poles that lacked the SPBs did not lead the division of the NE during spindle elongation, but deformed it, trapping the chromosomes within. When the SPBs were severed by laser microsurgery in wild-type cells, we observed analogous deformations of the NE by elongating spindle remnants, resulting in NE division failure. Analysis of dis1Delta cells that elongate spindles despite unattached kinetochores indicated that the SPBs were required for maintaining nuclear shape at anaphase onset. Strikingly, when the NE was disassembled by utilizing a temperature-sensitive allele of the Ran GEF, Pim1p, the abnormal spindles induced by Mia1p overexpression were capable of segregating sister chromatids to daughter cells, suggesting that the failure to divide the NE prevents chromosome partitioning. Our results imply that the SPBs preclude deformation of the NE during spindle elongation and thus serve as specialized structures enabling nuclear division during closed mitosis in fission yeast.},

abstract = {Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling determines crucial cell fate decisions in most cell types, and mediates cellular transformation in many types of cancer. The activity of MAPK is controlled by reversible phosphorylation, and the quantitative characteristics of MAPK activation determine the cellular response. Many systems biological studies have analyzed the activation kinetics and the dose-response behavior of the MAPK signaling pathway. Here we investigate how the pathway activity is controlled by transcriptional feedback loops. Initially, we predict that MAPK signaling regulates phosphatases, by integrating promoter sequence data and ontology-based classification of gene function. From this, we deduce that MAPK signaling might be controlled by transcriptional negative feedback regulation via dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), and implement a mathematical model to further test this hypothesis. Using time-resolved measurements of pathway activity and gene expression, we employ a model selection approach, and select DUSP6 as a highly likely candidate for shaping the activity of the MAPK pathway during cellular transformation caused by oncogenic RAS. Two predictions from the model were confirmed: first, feedback regulation requires that DUSP6 mRNA and protein are unstable; and second, the activation kinetics of MAPK are ultrasensitive. Taken together, an integrated systems biological approach reveals that transcriptional negative feedback controls the kinetics and the extent of MAPK activation under both physiological and pathological conditions.},

Estrogens also involve in the neuroendocrine, skeletal, adipogenesis, and cardiovascular systems. Estrogen signaling pathways are selectively stimulated or inhibited depending on a balance between the activities of estrogen receptor (ER) $\alpha$ or ER$\beta$ in target organs. ERs belong to the steroid hormone superfamily of nuclear receptors, which act as transcription factors after binding to estrogen. The gene expression regulation by ERs is to modulate biological activities, such as reproductive organ development, bone modeling, cardiovascular system functioning, metabolism, and behavior in both females and males. Understanding of the general physiological roles of ERs has been gained when estrogen levels were ablated by ovariectomy and then replenished by treatment with exogenous estrogen. This technique is not sufficient to fully determine the exact function of estrogen signaling in general processes in living tissues. However, a transgenic mouse model has been useful to study gene-specific functions. ER$\alpha$ and ER$\beta$ have different biological functions, and knockout and transgenic animal models have distinct phenotypes. Analysis of ER$\alpha$ and ER$\beta$ function using knockout mouse models has identified the roles of estrogen signaling in general physiologic processes. Although transgenic mouse models do not always produce consistent results, they are the useful for studying the functions of these genes under specific pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Transcriptional activation of a gene involves an orchestrated recruitment of components of the basal transcription machinery and intermediate factors, concomitant with an alteration in local chromatin structure generated by posttranslational modifications of histone tails and nucleosome remodeling. We provide here a comprehensive picture of events resulting in transcriptional activation of a gene, through evaluating the estrogen receptor-alpha (NR3A1) target pS2 gene promoter in MCF-7 cells. This description integrates chromatin remodeling with a kinetic evaluation of cyclical networks of association of 46 transcription factors with the promoter, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We define the concept of a "transcriptional clock" that directs and achieves the sequential and combinatorial assembly of a transcriptionally productive complex on a promoter. Furthermore, the unanticipated findings of key roles for histone deacetylases and nucleosome-remodeling complexes in limiting transcription implies that transcriptional activation is a cyclical process that requires both activating and repressive epigenetic processes.},

abstract = {Complex transcriptional behaviours are encoded in the DNA sequences of gene regulatory regions. Advances in our understanding of these behaviours have been recently gained through quantitative models that describe how molecules such as transcription factors and nucleosomes interact with genomic sequences. An emerging view is that every regulatory sequence is associated with a unique binding affinity landscape for each molecule and, consequently, with a unique set of molecule-binding configurations and transcriptional outputs. We present a quantitative framework based on existing methods that unifies these ideas. This framework explains many experimental observations regarding the binding patterns of factors and nucleosomes and the dynamics of transcriptional activation. It can also be used to model more complex phenomena such as transcriptional noise and the evolution of transcriptional regulation.},

We previously identified an interaction between the N-terminal A and C-terminal domains, which we demonstrate here to repress ligand-independent transactivation and transrepression abilities of ERalpha. Using targeted mutations based on ERalpha structural models, we determine the basis for this interaction that defines a regulatory interplay between ERalpha A domain, corepressors, and ERalpha Helix 12 for binding to the same C-terminal surface. We propose a dynamic model where binding of different ligands influences the A/D-F domain interaction and results in specific functional outcomes. This model gives insights into the dynamic properties of full-length ERalpha and into the structure of unliganded ERalpha.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, spindle orientation is controlled by a temporal and spatial program of microtubule (MT)-cortex interactions. This program requires Bud6p/Aip3p to direct the old pole to the bud and confine the new pole to the mother cell. Bud6p function has been linked to Kar9p, a protein guiding MTs along actin cables. Here, we show that Kar9p does not mediate Bud6p functions in spindle orientation. Based on live microscopy analysis, kar9Delta cells maintained Bud6p-dependent MT capture. Conversely, bud6Delta cells supported Kar9p-associated MT delivery to the bud. Moreover, additive phenotypes in bud6Delta kar9Delta or bud6Delta dyn1Delta mutants underscored the separate contributions of Bud6p, Kar9p, and dynein to spindle positioning. Finally, tub2C354S, a mutation decreasing MT dynamics, suppressed a kar9Delta mutation in a BUD6-dependent manner. Thus, Kar9p-independent capture at Bud6p sites can effect spindle orientation provided MT turnover is reduced. Together, these results demonstrate Bud6p function in MT capture at the cell cortex, independent of Kar9p-mediated MT delivery along actin cables.},

Analysis of MTOCs from different organisms shows that the structure of these organelles is widely varied even though they all share the function of microtubule nucleation. Despite their morphological diversity, many components and regulators of MTOCs, as well as principles in their assembly, seem to be conserved. This review focuses on one of the best-characterized MTOCs, the budding yeast spindle pole body (SPB). We review what is known about its structure, protein composition, duplication, regulation, and functions. In addition, we discuss how studies of the yeast SPB have aided investigation of other MTOCs, most notably the centrosome of animal cells.},

abstract = {The budding yeast spindle aligns along the mother- bud axis through interactions between cytoplasmic microtubules (CMs) and the cell cortex. Kar9, in complex with the EB1-related protein Bim1, mediates contacts of CMs with the cortex of the daughter cell, the bud. Here we established a novel series of events that target Kar9 to the bud cortex. First, Kar9 binds to spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in G(1) of the cell cycle. Secondly, in G(1)/S the yeast Cdk1, Cdc28, associates with SPBs and phosphorylates Kar9. Thirdly, Kar9 and Cdc28 then move from the SPB to the plus end of CMs directed towards the bud. This movement is dependent upon the microtubule motor protein Kip2. Cdc28 activity is required to concentrate Kar9 at the plus end of CMs and hence to establish contacts with the bud cortex. The Cdc28-regulated localization of Kar9 is therefore an integral part of the program that aligns spindles.},

abstract = {Cell division is the result of two major cytoskeletal events: partition of the chromatids by the mitotic spindle and cleavage of the cell by the cytokinetic apparatus. Spatial coordination of these events ensures that each daughter cell inherits a nucleus. Here we show that, in budding yeast, capture and shrinkage of astral microtubules at the bud neck is required to position the spindle relative to the cleavage apparatus. Capture required the septins and the microtubule-associated protein Kar9. Like Kar9-defective cells, cells lacking the septin ring failed to position their spindle correctly and showed an increased frequency of nuclear missegregation. Microtubule attachment at the bud neck was followed by shrinkage and a pulling action on the spindle. Enhancement of microtubule shrinkage at the bud neck required the Par-1-related, septin-dependent kinases (SDK) Hsl1 and Gin4. Neither the formin Bnr1 nor the actomyosin contractile ring was required for either microtubule capture or microtubule shrinkage. Together, our results indicate that septins and septin-dependent kinases may coordinate microtubule and actin functions in cell division.},

Dynamic and in part cyclical processes were observed on the level of translocation into the nucleus, association with genomic binding sites, exchange of co-regulators and chromatin modifiers, occurrence of chromatin marks, and activities of RNA polymerase II resulting in mRNA synthesis.

abstract = {Some biological regulatory systems must "remember" a state for long periods of time. A simple type of system that can accomplish this task is one in which two regulatory elements negatively regulate one another. For example, two repressor proteins might control one another's synthesis. Qualitative reasoning suggests that such a system will have two stable states, one in which the first element is "on" and the second "off", and another in which these states are reversed. Quantitative analysis shows that the existence of two stable steady states depends on the details of the system. Among other things, the shapes of functions describing the effect of one regulatory element on the other must meet certain criteria in order for two steady states to exist. Many biologically reasonable functions do not meet these criteria. In particular, repression that is well described by a Michaelis-Menten-type equation cannot lead to a working switch. However, functions describing positive cooperativity of binding, non-additive effects of multiple operator sites, or depletion of free repressor can lead to working switches.},

abstract = {Actin in eukaryotic cells is found in different pools, with filaments being organized into a variety of supramolecular assemblies. To investigate the assembly and functional relationships between different parts of the actin cytoskeleton in one cell, we studied the morphology and dynamics of cables and patches in yeast. The fine structure of actin cables and the manner in which cables disassemble support a model in which cables are composed of a number of overlapping actin filaments. No evidence for intrinsic polarity of cables was found. To investigate to what extent different parts of the actin cytoskeleton depend on each other, we looked for relationships between cables and patches. Patches and cables were often associated, and their polarized distributions were highly correlated. Therefore, patches and cables do appear to depend on each other for assembly and function. Many cell types show rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, which can occur via assembly or movement of actin filaments. In our studies, dramatic changes in actin polarization did not include changes in filamentous actin. In addition, the concentration of actin patches was relatively constant as cells grew. Therefore, cells do not have bursts of activity in which new parts of the actin cytoskeleton are created.},

However, analysis of early embryo development and tissue morphogenesis has highlighted the role of the spatial distribution of cortical cues able to guide spindle orientation. In vitro studies of cell division have revealed similar mechanisms. Recent data support the possibility that the orientation of cell division in mammalian cells is dominated by cell adhesion and the associated traction forces developed in interphase. Cell shape is a manifestation of these adhesive and tensional patterns. These patterns control the spatial distribution of cortical signals and thereby guide spindle orientation and daughter cell positioning. From these data, cell division appears to be a continuous transformation ensuring the maintenance of tissue mechanical integrity.},

A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Num1p fusion protein localizes at the bud tip and the distal mother pole of living cells, apparently forming cMT capture sites at late anaphase. In addition, galactose-induced GFP-Num1p is seen at the bud neck and in lateral regions of the mother cortex. The bud tip location of Num1p depends on Bni1p but does not require Kar9p, Dyn1p, or cMTs, whereas cMT contacts with polar Num1p dots are reduced in cells lacking Dyn1p. Num1p associates with the dynein intermediate chain Pac11p in the presence of Dyn1p, and with the alpha-tubulin Tub3p, as shown by coimmune precipitation of tagged proteins. Num1p also forms a complex with Bni1p and Kar9p, although Num1p is not required for Bni1p- and Kar9p-dependent nuclear migration to the bud neck in preanaphase cells. Our data suggest that Num1p controls nuclear migration during late anaphase by forming dynein-interacting cortical cMT capture sites at both cellular poles. In addition, Num1p may transiently cooperate with an associated Bni1p-Kar9p complex at the bud tip of early anaphase cells.},

abstract = {With only few exceptions that include Hes-1 p53, and IkappaB, the expression of genes has never been shown to be oscillatory. Here, we show that the inflammatory cytokine TNF triggers oscillations in >5000 genes. We utilize microarrays at 30-min intervals to analyze the pattern of global gene expression in murine macrophages. We find that 15\% of genes in the genome underwent a significant >3-fold increase in expression, with 89\% of these displaying oscillations at frequencies as low as every 50min. We analyze further two sub-clusters of genes that either began oscillating early or after a lag phase. Through the use of quantitative PCR, we confirm the oscillations and show that the oscillations are continuous. Moreover, we show that these continuous oscillations are not unique to TNF, but that related cytokines such as RANK-L produces oscillations with a unique induction profile. In the two papers accompanying this one, we analyze the mechanism of these oscillations and find that TNF also triggers oscillations in the phosphorylation of MAP kinases, and that these oscillations combine to recruit transcription factors to promoters in a cyclical fashion. The results presented here suggest that gene transcription is a highly dynamic processes, with thousands of genes displaying rapid (<60min) oscillations over time. Considering this dynamism, time-resolved measurements of gene transcription should become the experimental norm.},

The heads remained widely separated, and their stepping behavior varied as a function of interhead separation. One active head was sufficient for processive movement, and an active head could drag an inactive partner head forward. Thus, dynein moves processively without interhead coordination, a mechanism fundamentally distinct from the hand-over-hand stepping of kinesin and myosin.},

@article{Wee2012,
abstract = {Intracellular protein levels of diverse transcription factors (TFs) vary periodically with time. However, the effects of TF oscillations on gene expression, the primary role of TFs, are poorly understood. In this study, we determined these effects by comparing gene expression levels induced in the presence and in the absence of TF oscillations under same mean intracellular protein level of TF. For all the nonlinear TF transcription kinetics studied, an oscillatory TF is predicted to induce gene expression levels that are distinct from a nonoscillatory TF. The conditions dictating whether TF oscillations induce either higher or lower average gene expression levels were elucidated. Subsequently, the predicted effects from an oscillatory TF, which follows sigmoid transcription kinetics, were applied to demonstrate how oscillatory dynamics provide a mechanism for differential target gene transactivation. Generally, the mean TF concentration at which oscillations occur relative to the promoter binding affinity of a target gene determines whether the gene is up- or downregulated whereas the oscillation amplitude amplifies the magnitude of the differential regulation. Notably, the predicted trends of differential gene expressions induced by oscillatory NF-kB and gluco- corticoid receptor match the reported experimental observations. Furthermore, the biological function of p53 oscillations is predicted to prime the cell for death upon DNA damage via differential upregulation of apoptotic genes. Lastly, given N target genes, an oscillatory TF can generate between (N – 1) and (2N – 1) distinct patterns of differential transactivation. This study provides insights into the mechanism for TF oscillations to induce differential gene expressions, and underscores the importance of TF oscillations in biological regulations.},

The proposed method exploits the redundancy of the 3-D+time information to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of images corrupted by Poisson-Gaussian noise. A variance stabilization transform is first applied to the image-data to remove the dependence between the mean and variance of intensity values. This preprocessing requires the knowledge of parameters related to the acquisition system, also estimated in our approach. In a second step, we propose an original statistical patch-based framework for noise reduction and preservation of space-time discontinuities. In our study, discontinuities are related to small moving spots with high velocity observed in fluorescence video-microscopy. The idea is to minimize an objective nonlocal energy functional involving spatio-temporal image patches. The minimizer has a simple form and is defined as the weighted average of input data taken in spatially-varying neighborhoods. The size of each neighborhood is optimized to improve the performance of the pointwise estimator. The performance of the algorithm (which requires no motion estimation) is then evaluated on both synthetic and real image sequences using qualitative and quantitative criteria.},

@article{Legewie2008,
abstract = {Noncoding RNAs are crucial regulators of gene expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but how they affect the dynamics of transcriptional networks remains poorly understood. We analyzed the temporal characteristics of the cyanobacterial iron stress response by mathematical modeling and quantitative experimental analyses and focused on the role of a recently discovered small noncoding RNA, IsrR. We found that IsrR is responsible for a pronounced delay in the accumulation of isiA mRNA encoding the late-phase stress protein, IsiA, and that it ensures a rapid decline in isiA levels once external stress triggers are removed. These kinetic properties allow the system to selectively respond to sustained (as opposed to transient) stimuli and thus establish a temporal threshold, which prevents energetically costly IsiA accumulation under short-term stress conditions. Biological information is frequently encoded in the quantitative aspects of intracellular signals (e.g., amplitude and duration). Our simulations reveal that competitive inhibition and regulated degradation allow intracellular regulatory networks to efficiently discriminate between transient and sustained inputs.},

@article{Markaki2010,
abstract = {We studied the nuclear topography of RNA transcription and DNA replication in mammalian cell types with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, which offers a resolution beyond the classical Abbe/Raleigh limit. Three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) demonstrated a network of channels and wider lacunas, called the interchromatin compartment (IC). The IC starts at nuclear pores and expands throughout the nuclear space. It is demarcated from the compact interior of higher-order chromatin domains (CDs) by a 100-200-nm thick layer of decondensed chromatin, termed the perichromatin region (PR). Nascent DNA, nascent RNA, RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), as well as histone modifications for transcriptionally competent/active chromatin, are highly enriched in the PR, whereas splicing speckles are observed in the interior of the IC. In line with previous electron microscopic evidence, spectral precision distance/position determination microscopy (SPDM) confirmed the presence of RNA Pol II clusters indicative of transcription factories. Still, a substantial part of transcription apparently takes place outside of such factories. Previous electron microscopic evidence has suggested that the functional nuclear organization of DNA replication depends on Brownian movements of chromatin between the CD interior and the PR. As an incentive for future studies, we hypothesize that such movements also take place during transcription, i.e., only the actually transcribed part of a gene may be located within the PR, whereas its major part, including previously or later transcribed sequences, is embedded in a higher-order chromatin configuration in the interior of the CD.},

Estrogen-stimulated progesterone receptor levels remained basal but could be stimulated by estradiol. Estrogen receptor content increased steadily during adaptation, which may model the increasing levels of estrogen receptor observed in breast cancer with increasing patient age. The mechanism of the adaptation to low estrogen medium is unclear; however, cell lines such as MCF-7 may need to be cultured in the presence of an estrogen such as phenol red in order to maintain a stable estrogen-sensitive phenotype. On the other hand, maintenance of estrogen-dependent cells in low estrogen media may convert them to dependence on factors which are not currently understood. This may ultimately increase their value as models of hormone action.},

The association of dynein with cellular structures and the activation of its motility are crucial steps in dynein-dependent processes. However, the mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. In fungi, dynein is required for nuclear migration. In budding yeast, nuclear migration is driven by the interaction of astral microtubules with the cell cortex; the interaction is mediated by dynein that is probably associated with the cortex. Recent studies suggest that budding yeast dynein is first recruited to microtubules, then delivered to the cortex by microtubules and finally activated by association with the cortex. Nuclear migration in many other fungi is probably driven by a similar mechanism. Recruitment of dynein to microtubules and its subsequent activation upon association with cellular structures are perhaps common to many dynein-dependent eukaryotic processes, including organelle transport.},

@article{Shaw1997,
abstract = {Localization of dynein-green fluorescent protein (GFP) to cytoplasmic microtubules allowed us to obtain one of the first views of the dynamic properties of astral microtubules in live budding yeast. Several novel aspects of microtubule function were revealed by time-lapse, three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy. Astral microtubules, about four to six in number for each pole, exhibited asynchronous dynamic instability throughout the cell cycle, growing at approximately 0.3-1.5 micron/min toward the cell surface then switching to shortening at similar velocities back to the spindle pole body (SPB). During interphase, a conical array of microtubules trailed the SPB as the nucleus traversed the cytoplasm. Microtubule disassembly by nocodozole inhibited these movements, indicating that the nucleus was pushed around the interior of the cell via dynamic astral microtubules. These forays were evident in unbudded G1 cells, as well as in late telophase cells after spindle disassembly. Nuclear movement and orientation to the bud neck in S/G2 or G2/M was dependent on dynamic astral microtubules growing into the bud. The SPB and nucleus were then pulled toward the bud neck, and further microtubule growth from that SPB was mainly oriented toward the bud. After SPB separation and central spindle formation, a temporal delay in the acquisition of cytoplasmic dynein at one of the spindle poles was evident. Stable microtubule interactions with the cell cortex were rarely observed during anaphase, and did not appear to contribute significantly to spindle alignment or elongation into the bud. Alterations of microtubule dynamics, as observed in cells overexpressing dynein-GFP, resulted in eventual spindle misalignment. These studies provide the first mechanistic basis for understanding how spindle orientation and nuclear positioning are established and are indicative of a microtubule-based searching mechanism that requires dynamic microtubules for nuclear migration into the bud.},

@article{Glynn:2001p816,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In many cell types, microtubules are thought to direct the spatial distribution of F-actin in cell polarity. Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells exhibit a regulated program of polarized cell growth: after cell division, they grow first in a monopolar manner at the old end, and in G2 phase, initiate growth at the previous cell division site (the new end). The role of microtubule ends in cell polarity is highlighted by the finding that the cell polarity factor, tea1p, is present on microtubule plus ends and cell tips [1]. RESULTS: Here, we characterize S. pombe bud6p/fat1p, a homolog of S. cerevisiae Bud6/Aip3. bud6Delta mutant cells have a specific defect in the efficient initiation of growth at the new end and like tea1Delta cells, form T-shaped cells in a cdc11 background. Bud6-GFP localizes to both cell tips and the cytokinesis ring. Maintenance of cell tip localization is dependent upon actin but not microtubules. Bud6-GFP localization is tea1p dependent, and tea1p localization is not bud6p dependent. tea1Delta and bud6Delta cells generally grow in a monopolar manner but exhibit different growth patterns. tea1(Delta)bud6Delta mutants resemble tea1Delta mutants. Tea1p and bud6p coimmunoprecipitate and comigrate in large complexes. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that tea1p (a microtubule end-associated factor) and bud6p (an actin-associated factor) function in a common pathway, with bud6p downstream of tea1p. To our knowledge, bud6p is the first protein shown to interact physically with tea1p. These studies delineate a pathway for how microtubule plus ends function to polarize the actin cytoskeleton through actin-associated polarity factors.},

@article{Howard:2007p4017,
abstract = {Microtubules and other proteins self-organize into complex dynamic structures such as the mitotic spindle, which separates the chromosomes during cell division. Much is known about the individual molecular players involved in assembly and positioning of the mitotic spindle, but how they act together to generate the often unexpected behavior of the whole microtubule system is not understood. Two recent papers use a combination of experimental (imaging) and theoretical (computer simulation) methods to explore the formation of bipolar linear microtubule arrays in fission yeast and the oscillatory movement of the mitotic spindle in the nematode worm. In the simulation approach, the rules for the interactions of the components (microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins) are specified and the evolution of the system is followed, with the aim of identifying the minimal set of components that can mimic the real system. The work on fission yeast concludes that bipolar microtubule structures can arise from self-organization of microtubules through nucleators, bundlers, and sliders, without a requirement for a special microtubule-organizing center. The work on the worm embryo suggests that both the positive feedback that drives oscillations and the centering force that limits their amplitude may arise from microtubule pulling forces. The systems approach exemplified by these papers should stimulate new experiments aimed at discovering the principles of cellular organization.},

The 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method.

abstract = {To understand how multiprotein complexes assemble and function on chromatin, we combined quantitative analysis of the mammalian nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER) machinery in living cells with computational modeling. We found that individual NER components exchange within tens of seconds between the bound state in repair complexes and the diffusive state in the nucleoplasm, whereas their net accumulation at repair sites evolves over several hours. Based on these in vivo data, we developed a predictive kinetic model for the assembly and function of repair complexes. DNA repair is orchestrated by the interplay of reversible protein-binding events and progressive enzymatic modifications of the chromatin substrate. We demonstrate that faithful recognition of DNA lesions is time consuming, whereas subsequently, repair complexes form rapidly through random and reversible assembly of NER proteins. Our kinetic analysis of the NER system reveals a fundamental conflict between specificity and efficiency of chromatin-associated protein machineries and shows how a trade off is negotiated through reversibility of protein binding.},

abstract = {Robustness is one of the fundamental characteristics of biological systems. Numerous reports have been published on how robustness is involved in various biological processes and on mechanisms that give rise to robustness in living systems (Savageau, 1985a, 1985b, 1998; Barkai and Leibler, 1997; Alon et al, 1999; von Dassow et al, 2000; Bhalla and Iyengar, 2001; Csete and Doyle, 2002, 2004; Kitano et al, 2004, 2004a, 2004b; Stelling et al, 2004; Kitano and Oda, 2006; Kitano, 2007a). With increasing interest in systems biology, properties at the system level such as robustness have attracted serious scientific research. Nevertheless, a mathematical foundation that provides a unified perspective on robustness is yet to be established. For systems biology to mature into a solid scientific discipline, there must be a solid theoretical and methodological foundation. Often, systems biology is equated with computer simulation of cells and organs. Although computer simulation is a powerful technique for clarifying the complex dynamics of biological systems, it is also a useful tool for exploring the foundation of biological systems. While investigation on the dynamic properties of specific aspects of organisms is scientifically significant and can be widely applied, it is a study on specific instances of design within a design space that is shaped by fundamental principles, structural, environmental, and evolutionary constraints. The scientific goal of systems biology is not merely to create precision models of cells and organs, but also to discover fundamental and structural principles behind biological systems that define the possible design space of life (Figure 1). The value of understanding fundamental and structural theories is that they provide deeper insights into the governing principles that complex evolvable systems including biological systems follow. Building a solid theoretical foundation of biological robustness, and in particular defining a mathematical formulation of robustness, represents a key challenge in Systems Biology. Such a framework would be enormously useful, as it would provide general constraints on possible architectural features of living organisms. Figure 1},

abstract = {In individual mammalian cells the expression of some genes such as prolactin is highly variable over time and has been suggested to occur in stochastic pulses. To investigate the origins of this behavior and to understand its functional relevance, we quantitatively analyzed this variability using new mathematical tools that allowed us to reconstruct dynamic transcription rates of different reporter genes controlled by identical promoters in the same living cell. Quantitative microscopic analysis of two reporter genes, firefly luciferase and destabilized EGFP, was used to analyze the dynamics of prolactin promoter-directed gene expression in living individual clonal and primary pituitary cells over periods of up to 25 h. We quantified the time-dependence and cyclicity of the transcription pulses and estimated the length and variation of active and inactive transcription phases. We showed an average cycle period of approximately 11 h and demonstrated that while the measured time distribution of active phases agreed with commonly accepted models of transcription, the inactive phases were differently distributed and showed strong memory, with a refractory period of transcriptional inactivation close to 3 h. Cycles in transcription occurred at two distinct prolactin-promoter controlled reporter genes in the same individual clonal or primary cells. However, the timing of the cycles was independent and out-of-phase. For the first time, we have analyzed transcription dynamics from two equivalent loci in real-time in single cells. In unstimulated conditions, cells showed independent transcription dynamics at each locus. A key result from these analyses was the evidence for a minimum refractory period in the inactive-phase of transcription. The response to acute signals and the result of manipulation of histone acetylation was consistent with the hypothesis that this refractory period corresponded to a phase of chromatin remodeling which significantly increased the cyclicity. Stochastically timed bursts of transcription in an apparently random subset of cells in a tissue may thus produce an overall coordinated but heterogeneous phenotype capable of acute responses to stimuli.},

These properties, which include multistability and oscillations, have been found in specialized gene circuits such as the bacteriophage lambda switch and the Cyanobacteria circadian oscillator. However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch-a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network-in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.},

abstract = {In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, most genes appear to be transcribed during short periods called transcriptional bursts, interspersed by silent intervals. We describe how such bursts generate gene-specific temporal patterns of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis in mammalian cells. To monitor transcription at high temporal resolution, we established various gene trap cell lines and transgenic cell lines expressing a short-lived luciferase protein from an unstable mRNA, and recorded bioluminescence in real time in single cells. Mathematical modeling identified gene-specific on- and off-switching rates in transcriptional activity and mean numbers of mRNAs produced during the bursts. Transcriptional kinetics were markedly altered by cis-regulatory DNA elements. Our analysis demonstrated that bursting kinetics are highly gene-specific, reflecting refractory periods during which genes stay inactive for a certain time before switching on again.},

abstract = {Regulated gene expression, achieved through the coordinated assembly of transcription factors, co-regulators and the basal transcription machinery on promoters, is an initial step in accomplishing cell specificity and homeostasis. Traditional models of transcriptional regulation tend to be static, although gene expression profiles change with time to adapt to developmental and environmental cues. Furthermore, biochemical and structural studies have determined that initiation of transcription progresses through a series of ordered events. By integrating time into the analysis of transcription, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and live-cell imaging techniques have revealed the dynamic, cooperative, functionally redundant and cyclical nature of gene expression. In this review, we present a dynamic model of gene transcription that integrates data obtained by these two techniques.},

Such measurements have elucidated the transient nature of many nuclear interactions.

abstract = {Cells receive a wide variety of cellular and environmental signals, which are often processed combinatorially to generate specific genetic responses. Here we explore theoretically the potentials and limitations of combinatorial signal integration at the level of cis-regulatory transcription control. Our analysis suggests that many complex transcription-control functions of the type encountered in higher eukaryotes are already implementable within the much simpler bacterial transcription system. Using a quantitative model of bacterial transcription and invoking only specific protein-DNA interaction and weak glue-like interaction between regulatory proteins, we show explicit schemes to implement regulatory logic functions of increasing complexity by appropriately selecting the strengths and arranging the relative positions of the relevant protein-binding DNA sequences in the cis-regulatory region. The architectures that emerge are naturally modular and evolvable. Our results suggest that the transcription regulatory apparatus is a "programmable" computing machine, belonging formally to the class of Boltzmann machines. Crucial to our results is the ability to regulate gene expression at a distance. In bacteria, this can be achieved for isolated genes via DNA looping controlled by the dimerization of DNA-bound proteins. However, if adopted extensively in the genome, long-distance interaction can cause unintentional intergenic cross talk, a detrimental side effect difficult to overcome by the known bacterial transcription-regulation systems. This may be a key factor limiting the genome-wide adoption of complex transcription control in bacteria. Implications of our findings for combinatorial transcription control in eukaryotes are discussed.},

Several studies have shown that nuclear export of tRNAs is also regulated in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and rat hepatoma H4IIE cells during nutrient stress. However, recent studies suggest that nutrient stress does not affect nuclear tRNA export in several mammalian cell lines, including rat hepatoma H4IIE. Furthermore, in contrast to previous studies, data reported more recently established that nuclear export of mature tRNAs derived from intron-containing pre-tRNAs, but not mature tRNAs made from intronless precursors, is affected by nutrient stress in several species of  Saccharomyces , but not in the yeast  Kluyveromyces lactis . Here, we provide evidence suggesting that  Schizosaccharomyces pombe , like mammalian cells and K. lactis, but unlike Saccharomyces, do not directly regulate nuclear export of mature tRNAs made from intron-containing pre-tRNAs in response to nutrient stress. These studies collectively suggest that regulation of nuclear export of spliced tRNAs to the cytoplasm in response to nutrient availability may be limited to the genus Saccharomyces, which unlike other yeasts and higher eukaryotes produce energy for fermentative growth using respiration-independent pathways by downregulating the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain.},

We found that the centrosome loses its function as a microtubule organizing center during development of rodent hippocampal neurons. Axons still extended and regenerated through acentrosomal microtubule nucleation, and axons continued to grow after laser ablation of the centrosome in early neuronal development. Thus, decentralized microtubule assembly enables axon extension and regeneration, and, after axon initiation, acentrosomal microtubule nucleation arranges the cytoskeleton, which is the source of the sophisticated morphology of neurons.},

Since these actin-based motors are candidates to provide the molecular basis for many cellular movements, it is essential that motility researchers be aware of the complete set of myosins in a given organism. The availability of cDNA and/or draft genomic sequences from humans, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Dictyostelium discoideum has allowed us to tentatively define and compare the sets of myosin genes in these organisms. This analysis has also led to the identification of several putative myosin genes that may be of general interest. In humans, for example, we find a total of 40 known or predicted myosin genes including two new myosins-I, three new class II (conventional) myosins, a second member of the class III/ninaC myosins, a gene similar to the class XV deafness myosin, and a novel myosin sharing at most 33\% identity with other members of the superfamily. These myosins are in addition to the recently discovered class XVI myosin with N-terminal ankyrin repeats and two human genes with similarity to the class XVIII PDZ-myosin from mouse. We briefly describe these newly recognized myosins and extend our previous phylogenetic analysis of the myosin superfamily to include a comparison of the complete or nearly complete inventories of myosin genes from several experimentally important organisms.},

abstract = {Surviving in a diverse environment requires corresponding organism responses. At the cellular level, such adjustment relies on the transcription factors (TFs) which must rapidly find their target sequences amidst a vast amount of non-relevant sequences on DNA molecules. Whether these transcription factors locate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of speculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the protein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this paper, we study the above problem using Monte Carlo simulations by considering a simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of low affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites, corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip. We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations thereof by considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walks along the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and then re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and a hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then re-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the final probability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs can locate their targets on the experimental time scale even if they spend only 15\% of their search time diffusing freely in the solution. This agrees with recent experimental results obtained by Elf et al (2007 Science 316 1191) and is in contrast to previously reported theoretical predictions. Our results also agree with the experimental evidence for the role of chaperons and proteasomes in stabilizing and destabilizing TFs binding, respectively, during the regulation process. Therefore, the results of our manuscript can provide a refined theoretical framework for the process.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanistic basis of transcriptional regulation has been a central focus of molecular biology since its inception. New high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have revealed that most regulatory proteins bind thousands of sites in mammalian genomes. However, the functional significance of these binding sites remains unclear. We present a quantitative model of transcriptional regulation that suggests the contribution of each binding site to tissue-specific gene expression depends strongly on its position relative to the transcription start site. For three cell types, we show that, by considering binding position, it is possible to predict relative expression levels between cell types with an accuracy approaching the level of agreement between different experimental platforms. Our model suggests that, for the transcription factors profiled in these cell types, a regulatory site's influence on expression falls off almost linearly with distance from the transcription start site in a 10 kilobase range. Binding to both evolutionarily conserved and non-conserved sequences contributes significantly to transcriptional regulation. Our approach also reveals the quantitative, tissue-specific role of individual proteins in activating or repressing transcription. These results suggest that regulator binding position plays a previously unappreciated role in influencing expression and blurs the classical distinction between proximal promoter and distal binding events.},

However, even genetically identical cells in identical environments display variable phenotypes. Stochastic gene expression, or gene expression “noise,” has been suggested as a major source of this variability, and its physiological consequences have been topics of intense research for the last decade. Several recent studies have measured variability in protein and messenger RNA levels, and they have discovered strong connections between noise and gene regulation mechanisms. When integrated with discrete stochastic models, measurements of cell-to-cell variability provide a sensitive “fingerprint” with which to explore fundamental questions of gene regulation. In this review, we highlight several studies that used gene expression variability to develop a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of gene regulation.},

abstract = {The ability to polarize is a fundamental property of cells. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be a fertile ground for dissecting the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell polarity during growth. Here we discuss the signaling pathways that regulate polarity. In the second installment of this two-part commentary, which appears in the next issue of Journal of Cell Science, we discuss how the actin cytoskeleton responds to these signals and guides the polarity of essentially all events in the yeast cell cycle. During the cell cycle, yeast cells assume alternative states of polarized growth, which range from tightly focused apical growth to non-focused isotropic growth. RhoGTPases, and in particular Cdc42p, are essential to guiding this polarity. The distribution of Cdc42p at the cell cortex establishes cell polarity. Cyclin-dependent protein kinase, Ras, and heterotrimeric G proteins all modulate yeast cell polarity in part by altering the distribution of Cdc42p. In turn, Cdc42p generates feedback signals to these molecules in order to establish stable polarity states and coordinate cytoskeletal organization with the cell cycle. Given that many of these signaling pathways are present in both fungi and animals, they are probably ancient and conserved mechanisms for regulating polarity.},

We describe how such bursts generate gene-specific temporal patterns of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis in mammalian cells. To monitor transcription at high temporal resolution, we established various gene trap cell lines and transgenic cell lines expressing a short-lived luciferase protein from an unstable mRNA, and recorded bioluminescence in real time in single cells. Mathematical modeling identified gene-specific on- and off-switching rates in transcriptional activity and mean numbers of mRNAs produced during the bursts. Transcriptional kinetics were markedly altered by cis-regulatory DNA elements. Our analysis demonstrated that bursting kinetics are highly gene-specific, reflecting refractory periods during which genes stay inactive for a certain time before switching on again.},

Automatic quantification of the number of sudden and transient events observed in fluorescence microscopy is discussed in this paper. We propose a calibrated method based on the comparison of image patches expected to distinguish sudden appearing/vanishing fluorescent spots from other motion behaviors such as lateral movements. We analyze the performances of two statistical control procedures and compare the proposed approach to a frame difference approach using the same controls on a benchmark of synthetic image sequences. We have then selected a molecular model related to membrane trafficking and considered real image sequences obtained in cells stably expressing an endocytic-recycling trans-membrane protein, the Langerin-YFP, for validation. With this model, we targeted the efficient detection of fast and transient local fluorescence concentration arising in image sequences from a data base provided by two different microscopy modalities, wide field (WF) video microscopy using maximum intensity projection along the axial direction and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Finally, the proposed detection method is briefly used to statistically explore the effect of several perturbations on the rate of transient events detected on the pilot biological model.},

abstract = {Cell growth and division have to be tightly coordinated to keep the cell size constant over generations. Changes in cell size can be easily studied in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe because these cells have a cylindrical shape and grow only at the cell ends. However, the growth pattern of single cells is currently unclear. Linear, exponential, and bilinear growth models have been proposed. Here we measured the length of single fission yeast cells with high spatial precision and temporal resolution over the whole cell cycle by using time-lapse confocal microscopy of cells with green fluorescent protein-labeled plasma membrane. We show that the growth profile between cell separation and the subsequent mitosis is bilinear, consisting of two linear segments separated by a rate-change point (RCP). The change in growth rate occurred at the same relative time during the cell cycle and at the same relative extension for different temperatures. The growth rate before the RCP was independent of temperature, whereas the growth rate after the RCP increased with an increase in temperature, leading to clear bilinear growth profiles at higher temperatures. The RCP was not directly related to the initiation of growth at the new end (new end take-off). When DNA synthesis was inhibited by hydroxyurea, the RCP was not detected. This result suggests that completion of DNA synthesis is required for the increase in growth rate. We conclude that the growth of fission yeast cells is not a simple exponential growth, but a complex process with precise rates regulated by the events during the cell cycle.},

Here we use an analytic model to investigate the emergent noise properties of genetic systems. We find for a single gene that noise is essentially determined at the translational level, and that the mean and variance of protein concentration can be independently controlled. The noise strength immediately following single gene induction is almost twice the final steady-state value. We find that fluctuations in the concentrations of a regulatory protein can propagate through a genetic cascade; translational noise control could explain the inefficient translation rates observed for genes encoding such regulatory proteins. For an autoregulatory protein, we demonstrate that negative feedback efficiently decreases system noise. The model can be used to predict the noise characteristics of networks of arbitrary connectivity. The general procedure is further illustrated for an autocatalytic protein and a bistable genetic switch. The analysis of intrinsic noise reveals biological roles of gene network structures and can lead to a deeper understanding of their evolutionary origin.},

abstract = {During mitosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mitotic spindle moves into the mother-bud neck via dynein-dependent sliding of cytoplasmic microtubules along the cortex of the bud. Here we show that Pac1, the yeast homologue of the human lissencephaly protein LIS1, plays a key role in this process. First, genetic interactions placed Pac1 in the dynein/dynactin pathway. Second, cells lacking Pac1 failed to display microtubule sliding in the bud, resulting in defective mitotic spindle movement and nuclear segregation. Third, Pac1 localized to the plus ends (distal tips) of cytoplasmic microtubules in the bud. This localization did not depend on the dynein heavy chain Dyn1. Moreover, the Pac1 fluorescence intensity at the microtubule end was enhanced in cells lacking dynactin or the cortical attachment molecule Num1. Fourth, dynein heavy chain Dyn1 also localized to the tips of cytoplasmic microtubules in wild-type cells. Dynein localization required Pac1 and, like Pac1, was enhanced in cells lacking the dynactin component Arp1 or the cortical attachment molecule Num1. Our results suggest that Pac1 targets dynein to microtubule tips, which is necessary for sliding of microtubules along the bud cortex. Dynein must remain inactive until microtubule ends interact with the bud cortex, at which time dynein and Pac1 appear to be offloaded from the microtubule to the cortex.},

abstract = {Digital imaging has provided scientists with new opportunities to acquire and manipulate data using techniques that were difficult or impossible to employ in the past. Because digital images are easier to manipulate than film images, new problems have emerged. One growing concern in the scientific community is that digital images are not being handled with sufficient care. The problem is twofold: (1) the very small, yet troubling, number of intentional falsifications that have been identified, and (2) the more common unintentional, inappropriate manipulation of images for publication. Journals and professional societies have begun to address the issue with specific digital imaging guidelines. Unfortunately, the guidelines provided often do not come with instructions to explain their importance. Thus they deal with what should or should not be done, but not the associated 'why' that is required for understanding the rules. This article proposes 12 guidelines for scientific digital image manipulation and discusses the technical reasons behind these guidelines. These guidelines can be incorporated into lab meetings and graduate student training in order to provoke discussion and begin to bring an end to the culture of "data beautification".},

The content of NUM1 mRNA fluctuates during the cell cycle, reaching a maximum at S/G2 phase, and the translation product Num1p associates with the cortex of mother cells mainly during S, G2, and mitosis, as seen by indirect immunofluorescence. The nuclear spindle in NUM1-deficient large-budded cells often fails to align along the mother/bud axis, while abnormally elongated astral microtubules emanate from both spindle pole bodies. A num1 null mutation confers temperature sensitivity to the cold-sensitive alpha-tubulin mutant tub1-1, and shows synthetic lethality with the beta-tubulin mutant alleles tub2-402, tub2-403, tub2-404, and tub2-405. Deletion mapping has defined three functionally important Num1p regions: a potential EF hand Ca2+ binding site, a cluster of potential phosphorylation sites and a pleckstrin homology domain. The latter domain appears to be involved in targeting Num1p to the mother cell cortex. Our data suggest that the periodically expressed NUM1 gene product controls nuclear migration by affecting astral microtubule functions.},

abstract = {Kinetochore components play a major role in regulating the transmission of genetic information during cell division. Ndc10p, a kinetochore component of the essential CBF3 complex in budding yeast is required for chromosome attachment to the mitotic spindle. ndc10-1 mutant was shown to display chromosome mis-segregation as well as an aberrant mitotic spindle (Goh and Kilmartin, 1993). In addition, Ndc10p localizes along the spindle microtubules (Muller-Reichert et al., 2003). To further understand the role of Ndc10p in the mitotic apparatus, we performed a three-dimensional electron microscopy (EM) reconstruction of mitotic spindles from serial sections of cryo-immobilized ndc10-1 mutant cells. This analysis reveals a dramatic reduction in the number of microtubules present in the half-spindle, which is connected to the newly formed spindle pole body (SPB) in ndc10-1 cells. Moreover, in contrast to wild-type (WT) cells, ndc10-1 cells showed a significantly lower signal intensity of the SPB components Spc42p and Spc110p fused with GFP, in mother cell bodies compared with buds. A subsequent EM analysis also showed clear defects in the newly formed SPB, which remains in the mother cell during anaphase. These results suggest that Ndc10p is required for maturation of the newly formed SPB. Intriguingly, mutations in other kinetochore components, ndc80-1 and spc24-1, showed kinetochore detachment from the spindle, similar to ndc10-1, but did not display defects in SPBs. This suggests that unattached kinetochores are not sufficient to cause SPB defects in ndc10-1 cells. We propose that Ndc10p, alongside its role in kinetochore-microtubule interaction, is also essential for SPB maturation and mitotic spindle integrity.},

abstract = {The role of gamma-tubulin in microtubule nucleation is well established, however, its function in other aspects of microtubule organization is unknown. The carboxy termini of alpha/beta-tubulins influence the assembly and stability of microtubules. We investigated the role of the carboxy terminus of yeast gamma-tubulin (Tub4p) in microtubule organization. This region consists of a conserved domain (DSYLD), and acidic tail. Cells expressing truncations lacking the DSYLD domain, tail or both regions are temperature sensitive for growth. Growth defects of tub4 mutants lacking either or both carboxy-terminal domains are suppressed by the microtubule destabilizing drug benomyl. tub4 carboxy-terminal mutants arrest as large budded cells with short bipolar spindles positioned at the bud neck. Electron microscopic analysis of wild-type and CTR mutant cells reveals that SPBs are tightly associated with the bud neck/cortex by cytoplasmic microtubules in mutants lacking the tail region (tub4-delta 444, tub4-delta 448). Mutants lacking the DSYLD residues (tub4-delta 444, tub4-delta DSYLD) form many cytoplasmic microtubules. We propose that the carboxy terminus of Tub4p is required for re-organization of the microtubules upon completion of nuclear migration, and facilitates spindle elongation into the bud.},

In a living Escherichia coli cell, we directly observed specific binding of a lac repressor, labeled with a fluorescent protein, to a chromosomal lac operator. Using single-molecule detection techniques, we measured the kinetics of binding and dissociation of the repressor in response to metabolic signals. Furthermore, we characterized the nonspecific binding to DNA, one-dimensional (1D) diffusion along DNA segments, and 3D translocation among segments through cytoplasm at the single-molecule level. In searching for the operator, a lac repressor spends approximately 90\% of time nonspecifically bound to and diffusing along DNA with a residence time of <5 milliseconds. The methods and findings can be generalized to other nucleic acid binding proteins.},

However, it is a complex technique, there are substantial problems associated with its true sensitivity, reproducibility and specificity and, as a quantitative method, it suffers from the problems inherent in PCR. The recent introduction of fluorescence-based kinetic RT-PCR procedures significantly simplifies the process of producing reproducible quantification of mRNAs and promises to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, their successful application depends on a clear understanding of the practical problems, and careful experimental design, application and validation remain essential for accurate quantitative measurements of transcription. This review discusses the technical aspects involved, contrasts conventional and kinetic RT-PCR methods for quantitating gene expression and compares the different kinetic RT-PCR systems. It illustrates the usefulness of these assays by demonstrating the significantly different levels of transcription between individuals of the housekeeping gene family, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH).},

Their purpose is to transmit and integrate information across cellular dimensions and help turn a disorderly mob of macromolecules into a spatially organized, living cell. Information, in this context, includes physical and chemical properties relevant to cellular physiology, including: the number and activity of macromolecules, cell shape, and mechanical force. Most animal cells are 10-50 microns in diameter, whereas the macromolecules that comprise them are 10,000-fold smaller (2-20 nm). To establish long-range order over cellular length scales, individual molecules must, therefore, self-assemble into larger polymers, with lengths (0.1-20 m) comparable to the size of a cell. These polymers must then be cross-linked into organized networks that fill the cytoplasm. Such cell-spanning polymer networks enable different parts of the cytoplasm to communicate directly with each other, either by transmitting forces or by carrying cargo from one spot to another.},

@article{Mastro1984,
abstract = {Measurements of diffusion of molecules in cells can provide information about cytoplasmic viscosity and structure. In a series of studies electron-spin resonance was used to measure the diffusion of a small spin label in the aqueous cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Translational and rotational motion were determined from the same spectra. Based on measurements made in model systems, it was hypothesized that calculations of the apparent viscosity of the cytoplasm from both rotational and translational motion would distinguish between the effects of viscosity and structure on diffusion. The diffusion constant measured in several cell lines averaged 3.3 X 10(-6) cm2/s. It was greater in growing cells and in cells treated with cytochalasin B than in quiescent cells. The viscosity of the cytoplasm calculated from the translational diffusion constant or the rotational correlation time was 2.0-3.0 centipoise, about two to three times that of the spin label in water. Therefore, over the dimensions measured by the technique, 50-100 A, solvent viscosity appears to be the major determinant of particle movement in cells under physiologic conditions. However, when cells were subjected to hypertonic conditions, the translational motion of the spin label decreased threefold, whereas the rotational motion changed by less than 20\%. These data suggest that the decrease in cell volume under hypertonic conditions is accompanied by an increase in cytoplasmic barriers and a decrease in the space between existing cytoplasmic components without a significant increase in viscosity in the aqueous phase. In addition, a comparison of reported diffusion values of a variety of molecules in water and in cells indicates that cytoplasmic structure plays an important role in the diffusion of proteins such as bovine serum albumin.},

abstract = {Actin cables, bundles of actin filaments that align along the long axis of budding yeast, are crucial for establishment of cell polarity. We fused green fluorescent protein (GFP) to actin binding protein 140 (Abp140p) and visualized actin cable dynamics in living yeast. We detected two populations of actin cables: (i) bud-associated cables, which extend from the bud along the mother-bud axis, and (ii) randomly oriented cables, which are relatively short. Time-lapse imaging of Abp140p-GFP revealed an apparent increase in the length of bud-associated actin cables. Analysis of movement of Abp140p-GFP fiduciary marks on bud-associated cables and fluorescence loss in photobleaching experiments revealed that this apparent elongation occurs by assembly of new material at the end of the cable within the bud and movement of the opposite end of the cable toward the tip of the mother cell distal to the bud. The rate of extension of the tip of an elongating actin cable is 0.29 +/- 0.08 microm/s. Latrunculin A (Lat-A) treatment completely blocked this process. We also observed movement of randomly oriented cables around the cortex of cells at a rate of 0.59 +/- 0.14 microm/s. Mild treatment with Lat-A did not affect the velocity of movement of randomly oriented cables. However, Lat-A treatment did increase the number of randomly oriented, motile cables per cell. Our observations suggest that establishment of bud-associated actin cables during the cell cycle is accomplished not by realignment of existing cables but by assembly of new cables within the bud or bud neck, followed by elongation.},

abstract = {We present an integrated model of hERalpha-mediated transcription where both unliganded and liganded receptors cycle on estrogen-responsive promoters. Using ChIP, FRAP, and biochemical analysis we evaluate hERalpha at several points in these cycles, establishing the ubiquitination status and subnuclear distribution of hERalpha, its mobility, the kinetics of transcriptional activation, and the cyclic recruitment of E3 ligases and the 19S regulatory component of the proteasome. These experiments, together with an evaluation of the inhibition of transcription and proteasome action, demonstrate that proteasome-mediated degradation and hERalpha-mediated transactivation are inherently linked and act to continuously turn over hERalpha on responsive promoters. Cyclic turnover of hERalpha permits continuous responses to changes in the concentration of estradiol.},

Mechanical measures were extracted as a quantitative tool from the histone density fluctuations inside the cell to obtain structural fluctuations on the scale of several micrometers. Results show that different mechanisms of expression of the same nuclear protein type lead to significantly different patterns on the nanoscale and to pronounced differences in the detected compressibility of chromatin. The observed fluctuations, including the experimental evidence for dynamic looping, are consistent with a recently proposed chromatin model.},

R is one of the most powerful and flexible statistical software packages available, and enables the user to apply a wide variety of statistical methods ranging from simple regression to generalized linear modelling. Statistics: An Introduction using R is a clear and concise introductory textbook to statistical analysis using this powerful and free software, and follows on from the success of the author's previous best-selling title Statistical Computing. * Features step-by-step instructions that assume no mathematics, statistics or programming background, helping the non-statistician to fully understand the methodology. * Uses a series of realistic examples, developing step-wise from the simplest cases, with the emphasis on checking the assumptions (e.g. constancy of variance and normality of errors) and the adequacy of the model chosen to fit the data. * The emphasis throughout is on estimation of effect sizes and confidence intervals, rather than on hypothesis testing. * Covers the full range of statistical techniques likely to be need to analyse the data from research projects, including elementary material like t-tests and chi-squared tests, intermediate methods like regression and analysis of variance, and more advanced techniques like generalized linear modelling. * Includes numerous worked examples and exercises within each chapter. * Accompanied by a website featuring worked examples, data sets, exercises and solutions: http://www.imperial.ac.uk/bio/research/crawley/statistics Statistics: An Introduction using R is the first text to offer such a concise introduction to a broad array of statistical methods, at a level that is elementary enough to appeal to a broad range of disciplines. It is primarily aimed at undergraduate students in medicine, engineering, economics and biology - but will also appeal to postgraduates who have not previously covered this area, or wish to switch to using R.},

@article{Tark-Dame2011,
abstract = {There is rapidly growing evidence that folding of the chromatin fibre inside the interphase nucleus has an important role in the regulation of gene expression. In particular, the formation of loops mediated by the interaction between specific regulatory elements, for instance enhancers and promoters, is crucial in gene control. Biochemical studies that were based on the chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology have confirmed that eukaryotic genomes are highly looped. Insight into the underlying principles comes from polymer models that explore the properties of the chromatin fibre inside the nucleus. Recent models indicate that chromatin looping can explain various properties of interphase chromatin, including chromatin compaction and compartmentalisation of chromosomes. Entropic effects have a key role in these models. In this Commentary, we give an overview of the recent conjunction of ideas regarding chromatin looping in the fields of biology and polymer physics. Starting from simple linear polymer models, we explain how specific folding properties emerge upon introducing loops and how this explains a variety of experimental observations. We also discuss different polymer models that describe chromatin folding and compare them to experimental data. Experimentally testing the predictions of such polymer models and their subsequent improvement on the basis of measurements provides a solid framework to begin to understand how our genome is folded and how folding relates to function.},

This analysis unveils in the cytoplasm two length scales: (i) the correlation length $\xi$ (approximately 5 nm in HeLa and 7 nm in Swiss 3T3 cells) and (ii) the limiting length scale that marks the crossover between nano- and macroscale viscosity (approximately 86 nm in HeLa and 30 nm in Swiss 3T3 cells). During motion, probes smaller than $\xi$ experienced matrix viscosity: $\eta$(matrix) ≈ 2.0 mPa·s for HeLa and 0.88 mPa·s for Swiss 3T3 cells. Probes much larger than the limiting length scale experienced macroscopic viscosity, $\eta$(macro) ≈ 4.4 × 10(-2) and 2.4 × 10(-2) Pa·s for HeLa and Swiss 3T3 cells, respectively.

@article{Segal2000,
abstract = {In budding yeast, spindle polarity relies on a precise temporal program of cytoplasmic microtubule-cortex interactions throughout spindle assembly. Loss of Clb5-dependent kinase activity under conditions of attenuated Cdc28 function disrupts this program, resulting in diploid-specific lethality. Here we show that polarity loss is tolerated by haploids due to a more prominent contribution of microtubule-neck interactions to spindle orientation inherent to haploids. These differences are mediated by the relative partition of Bud6 between the bud tip and bud neck, distinguishing haploids from diploids. Bud6 localizes initially to the bud tip and accumulates at the neck concomitant with spindle assembly. bud6Delta mutant phenotypes are consistent with Bud6's role as a cortical cue for cytoplasmic microtubule capture. Moreover, mutations that affect Bud6 localization and partitioning disrupt the sequential program of microtubule-cortex interactions accordingly. These data support a model whereby Bud6 sequentially cues microtubule capture events at the bud tip followed by capture events at the bud neck, necessary for correct spindle morphogenesis and polarity.},

Here, we show that in contrast to yeast, DNA at human promoters, enhancers, and TFBSs generally encodes high intrinsic nucleosome occupancy. In most cases we examined, these elements also have high experimentally measured nucleosome occupancy in vivo. These regions typically have high G+C content, which correlates positively with intrinsic nucleosome occupancy, and are depleted for nucleosome-excluding poly-A sequences. We propose that high nucleosome preference is directly encoded at regulatory sequences in the human genome to restrict access to regulatory information that will ultimately be utilized in only a subset of differentiated cells.},

Thermodynamic models provide a useful framework for the quantitative analysis of bacterial transcription regulation. This framework can facilitate the quantification of vastly different forms of gene expression from several well-characterized bacterial promoters that are regulated by one or two species of transcription factors; it is useful because it requires only a few parameters. As such, it provides a compact description useful for higher-level studies (e.g. of genetic networks) without the need to invoke the biochemical details of every component.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Promoter-driven reporter genes, notably luciferase and green fluorescent protein, provide a tool for the generation of a vast array of time-course data sets from living cells and organisms. The aim of this study is to introduce a modeling framework based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that addresses the problem of reconstructing transcription time-course profiles and associated degradation rates. The dynamical model is embedded into a Bayesian framework and inference is performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. RESULTS: We present three case studies where the methodology is used to reconstruct unobserved transcription profiles and to estimate associated degradation rates. We discuss advantages and limits of fitting either SDEs ODEs and address the problem of parameter identifiability when model variables are unobserved. We also suggest functional forms, such as on/off switches and stimulus response functions to model transcriptional dynamics and present results of fitting these to experimental data.},

abstract = {Crosstalk mechanisms have not been studied as thoroughly as individual signaling pathways. We exploit experimental and computational approaches to reveal how a concordant interplay between the insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling networks can potentiate mitogenic signaling. In HEK293 cells, insulin is a poor activator of the Ras/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) cascade, yet it enhances ERK activation by low EGF doses. We find that major crosstalk mechanisms that amplify ERK signaling are localized upstream of Ras and at the Ras/Raf level. Computational modeling unveils how critical network nodes, the adaptor proteins GAB1 and insulin receptor substrate (IRS), Src kinase, and phosphatase SHP2, convert insulin-induced increase in the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)) concentration into enhanced Ras/ERK activity. The model predicts and experiments confirm that insulin-induced amplification of mitogenic signaling is abolished by disrupting PIP(3)-mediated positive feedback via GAB1 and IRS. We demonstrate that GAB1 behaves as a non-linear amplifier of mitogenic responses and insulin endows EGF signaling with robustness to GAB1 suppression. Our results show the feasibility of using computational models to identify key target combinations and predict complex cellular responses to a mixture of external cues.},

@article{Bronstein2010,
abstract = {It is increasingly clear that transcription factors play versatile roles in turning genes "on" or "off" depending on cellular context via the various transcription complexes they form. This poses a major challenge in unraveling combinatorial transcription complex codes. Here we use the powerful genetics of Drosophila combined with microarray and bioinformatics analyses to tackle this challenge. The nuclear adaptor CHIP/LDB is a major developmental regulator capable of forming tissue-specific transcription complexes with various types of transcription factors and cofactors, making it a valuable model to study the intricacies of gene regulation. To date only few CHIP/LDB complexes target genes have been identified, and possible tissue-dependent crosstalk between these complexes has not been rigorously explored. SSDP proteins protect CHIP/LDB complexes from proteasome dependent degradation and are rate-limiting cofactors for these complexes. By using mutations in SSDP, we identified 189 down-stream targets of CHIP/LDB and show that these genes are enriched for the binding sites of APTEROUS (AP) and PANNIER (PNR), two well studied transcription factors associated with CHIP/LDB complexes. We performed extensive genetic screens and identified target genes that genetically interact with components of CHIP/LDB complexes in directing the development of the wings (28 genes) and thoracic bristles (23 genes). Moreover, by in vivo RNAi silencing we uncovered novel roles for two of the target genes, xbp1 and Gs-alpha, in early development of these structures. Taken together, our results suggest that loss of SSDP disrupts the normal balance between the CHIP-AP and the CHIP-PNR transcription complexes, resulting in down-regulation of CHIP-AP target genes and the concomitant up-regulation of CHIP-PNR target genes. Understanding the combinatorial nature of transcription complexes as presented here is crucial to the study of transcription regulation of gene batteries required for development.},

The rates of transcription initiation and termination and messenger RNA processing could be determined by positioning probes along the transcription unit.

Using a combination of theory and experiments, we have investigated spindle orientation in HeLa (human) cells. Here we show that spindle orientation can be understood as the result of the action of cortical force generators, which interact with spindle microtubules and are activated by cortical cues. We develop a simple physical description of this spindle mechanics, which allows us to calculate angular profiles of the torque acting on the spindle, as well as the angular distribution of spindle orientations. Our model accounts for the preferred spindle orientation and the shape of the full angular distribution of spindle orientations observed in a large variety of different cellular microenvironment geometries. It also correctly describes asymmetric spindle orientations, which are observed for certain distributions of cortical cues. We conclude that, on the basis of a few simple assumptions, we can provide a quantitative description of the spindle orientation of adherent cells.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: During anaphase B in mitosis, polymerization and sliding of overlapping spindle microtubules (MTs) contribute to the outward movement the spindle pole bodies (SPBs). To probe the mechanism of spindle elongation, we combine fluorescence microscopy, photobleaching, and laser microsurgery in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. RESULTS: We demonstrate that a green laser cuts intracellular structures in yeast cells with high spatial specificity. By using laser microsurgery, we cut mitotic spindles labeled with GFP-tubulin at various stages of anaphase B. Although cutting generally caused early anaphase spindles to disassemble, midanaphase spindle fragments continued to elongate. In particular, when the spindle was cut near a SPB, the larger spindle fragment continued to elongate in the direction of the cut. Photobleach marks showed that sliding of overlapping midzone MTs was responsible for the elongation of the spindle fragment. Spindle midzone fragments not connected to either of the two spindle poles also elongated. Equatorial microtubule organizing center (eMTOC) activity was not affected in cells with one detached pole but was delayed or absent in cells with two detached poles. CONCLUSIONS: These studies reveal that the spindle midzone is necessary and sufficient for the stabilization of MT ends and for spindle elongation. By contrast, SPBs are not required for elongation, but they contribute to the attachment of the nuclear envelope and chromosomes to the spindle, and to cell cycle progression. Laser microsurgery provides a means by which to dissect the mechanics of the spindle in yeast.},

The altered plasmid contained 2 sequential estrogen response elements (ERE) coupled to a human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter inserted upstream from a cDNA sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) with a 3'-polyadenylation signal. The plasmid was linearized and transfected into MCF-7 cells, a human breast cancer-derived line that expresses the estrogen receptor (ER). No selectable marker was present in the plasmid, requiring stably transfected cells to be selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on GFP expression after the cells were treated with 10-9 M 17\{beta\}-estradiol (E2). Stably transfected MCF-7 cells (MCF7-ERE) exhibited 2000-3000 times more fluorescence at 488 nm excitation and 512 nm emission than non-transfected cells. MCF7-ERE cells exhibited a linear increase in GFP expression induced over a range of 10-12 M E2, a concentration giving 2 times the background expression, to maximal expression at 3 x 0-10 M E2. From the maximal level, GFP expression plateaued, and then declined when E2 was increased to the highest concentration tested, 10-7 M. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (TFN-OH) treatment of cells produced a dose-dependent inhibition of E2-induced GFP expression, indicating the interaction of ER in the regulation of GFP gene expression. A series of estrogenic chemicals were evaluated for their capacity to induce GFP expression in MCF7-ERE cells, showing induced expression of GFP at concentrations 2-4 log units higher than the E2 concentration giving maximal GFP expression. The ERE-PGK-GFP reporter gene system is capable of rapid GFP expression in the presence of low concentrations of E2, and of quantifying estrogenicity of chemicals compared with a standard curve of the natural ligand, 17\{beta\}-estradiol.},

abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is an inherently noisy process. The origins of this stochastic behavior can be traced to the random transitions among the discrete chemical states of operators that control the transcription rate and to finite number fluctuations in the biochemical reactions for the synthesis and degradation of transcripts. We develop stochastic models to which these random reactions are intrinsic and a series of simpler models derived explicitly from the first as approximations in different parameter regimes. This innate stochasticity can have both a quantitative and qualitative impact on the behavior of gene-regulatory networks. We introduce a natural generalization of deterministic bifurcations for classification of stochastic systems and show that simple noisy genetic switches have rich bifurcation structures; among them, bifurcations driven solely by changing the rate of operator fluctuations even as the underlying deterministic system remains unchanged. We find stochastic bistability where the deterministic equations predict monostability and vice-versa. We derive and solve equations for the mean waiting times for spontaneous transitions between quasistable states in these switches.},

abstract = {Proper orientation of the mitotic spindle is critical for successful cell division in budding yeast. To investigate the mechanism of spindle orientation, we used a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tubulin fusion protein to observe microtubules in living yeast cells. GFP-tubulin is incorporated into microtubules, allowing visualization of both cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules, and does not interfere with normal microtubule function. Microtubules in yeast cells exhibit dynamic instability, although they grow and shrink more slowly than microtubules in animal cells. The dynamic properties of yeast microtubules are modulated during the cell cycle. The behavior of cytoplasmic microtubules revealed distinct interactions with the cell cortex that result in associated spindle movement and orientation. Dynein-mutant cells had defects in these cortical interactions, resulting in misoriented spindles. In addition, microtubule dynamics were altered in the absence of dynein. These results indicate that microtubules and dynein interact to produce dynamic cortical interactions, and that these interactions result in the force driving spindle orientation.},

The reads obtained from this can then be aligned to a reference genome in order to construct a whole-genome transcriptome map.

abstract = {Class-V myosins, one of 15 known classes of actin-based molecular motors, have been implicated in several forms of organelle transport, perhaps working with microtubule-based motors such as kinesin. Such movements may require a motor with mechanochemical properties distinct from those of myosin-II, which operates in large ensembles to drive high-speed motility as in muscle contraction. Based on its function and biochemistry, it has been suggested that myosin-V may be a processive motor like kinesin. Processivity means that the motor undergoes multiple catalytic cycles and coupled mechanical advances for each diffusional encounter with its track. This allows single motors to support movement of an organelle along its track. Here we provide direct evidence that myosin-V is indeed a processive actin-based motor that can move in large steps approximating the 36-nm pseudo-repeat of the actin filament.},

abstract = {A statistical thermodynamic model has been developed to account for the cooperative interactions of the bacteriophage lambda repressor with the lambda right operator. The model incorporates a general theory for quantitatively interpreting cooperative site-specific equilibrium binding data. Values for all interaction parameters of the model have been evaluated at 37 degrees C, 0.2 M KCl, from results of DNase protection experiments in vitro [A. D. Johnson, B. J. Meyer, \& M. Ptashne, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1979) 76, 5061-5065]. With these values, the model predicts repression curves at the divergent promoters PR and PRM that control transcription of genes coding for the regulatory proteins cro and repressor, respectively. At physiological repressor concentrations, repression at PR is predicted to be nearly complete whereas PRM is predicted to remain highly active. The results demonstrate the importance of cooperative interactions between repressor dimers bound to the adjacent operator sites OR1 and OR2 in maintaining a stable lysogenic state and in allowing efficient switchover to the lytic state during induction.},

Photobleaching and photoactivation of fluorescent MS2 proteins used to label nascent messenger RNAs provided sensitive elongation measurements. A mechanistic kinetic model that fits our data was validated using specific inhibitors. Polymerases elongated at 4.3 kilobases min(-1), much faster than previously documented, and entered a paused state for unexpectedly long times. Transcription onset was inefficient, with only 1\% of polymerase-gene interactions leading to completion of an mRNA. Our systems approach, quantifying both polymerase and mRNA kinetics on a defined DNA template in vivo with high temporal resolution, opens new avenues for studying regulation of transcriptional processes in vivo.},

abstract = {Synthetic biology is an emerging field that aims at constructing artificial biological systems by combining engineering and molecular biology approaches. One of the most ambitious research line concerns the so-called semi-synthetic minimal cells, which are liposome-based system capable of synthesizing the lipids within the liposome surface. This goal can be reached by reconstituting membrane proteins within liposomes and allow them to synthesize lipids. This approach, that can be defined as biochemical, was already reported by us (Schmidli et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 8127-8130, 1991). In more advanced models, however, a full reconstruction of the biochemical pathway requires (1) the synthesis of functional membrane enzymes inside liposomes, and (2) the local synthesis of lipids as catalyzed by the in situ synthesized enzymes. Here we show the synthesis and the activity--inside liposomes--of two membrane proteins involved in phospholipids biosynthesis pathway. The proteins, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT), have been synthesized by using a totally reconstructed cell-free system (PURE system) encapsulated in liposomes. The activities of internally synthesized GPAT and LPAAT were confirmed by detecting the produced lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid, respectively. Through this procedure, we have implemented the first phase of a design aimed at synthesizing phospholipid membrane from liposome within from within - which corresponds to the autopoietic growth mechanism.},

Although it is often described as a "gold" standard, it is far from being a standard assay. The significant problems caused by variability of RNA templates, assay designs and protocols, as well as inappropriate data normalization and inconsistent data analysis, are widely known but also widely disregarded. As a first step towards standardization, we describe a series of RT-qPCR protocols that illustrate the essential technical steps required to generate quantitative data that are reliable and reproducible. We would like to emphasize, however, that RT-qPCR data constitute only a snapshot of information regarding the quantity of a given transcript in a cell or tissue. Any assessment of the biological consequences of variable mRNA levels must include additional information regarding regulatory RNAs, protein levels and protein activity. The entire protocol described here, encompassing all stages from initial assay design to reliable qPCR data analysis, requires approximately 15 h.},

abstract = {Phytoestrogens are a chemically diverse group of compounds made by plants that can have estrogenic effects in animals. Both tumorigenic and antitumorigenic effects have been reported. Although estrogens stimulate the growth of many breast tumors, there is a negative correlation between the incidence of breast cancer and the phytoestrogen-rich diet of certain Asian populations. To begin to resolve this paradox, we have analyzed the estrogenic properties of genistein and quercetin, two flavonoid phytoestrogens particularly abundant in soybeans. Trans-activation experiments with a transfected reporter gene for nuclear estrogen receptors (ER) show strong activation of the endogenous ER alpha by both phytoestrogens in two MCF7 human breast cancer cell lines. This is supported by the observation that the two phytoestrogens induce the down-regulation of ER alpha mRNA and protein levels. Using chimeric proteins consisting of the hormone binding domains of ER alpha and ER beta fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, we have established that genistein and quercetin are full estrogenic agonists of both ER isoforms. Ligand binding experiments with purified ER alpha and ER beta confirm that the two phytoestrogens are ER ligands. At concentrations that are sufficient to obtain substantial transcriptional activity, they stimulate the proliferation of two ER alpha-dependent breast cancer cell lines. At high concentrations, such as those reached with a soy-rich diet, genistein and quercetin are strong cytotoxic agents that even kill ER-independent HeLa cells. Thus, the mode of action of phytoestrogens and the balance between being risk or chemopreventive factors for breast cancer may depend on the dietary load.},

@article{Hager2004,
abstract = {Following a hormone signal, steroid/nuclear receptors bind regulatory elements in chromatin and initiate the recruitment of a variety of multi-protein complexes to promoter sequences. These complexes ultimately lead to the recruitment of general transcription factors and the initiation of transcription. Traditional models suggest that these factors remain statically bound to each other and to chromatin until other signals are received to reduce transcription. Recent findings demonstrate that the processes and actions involved are much more complex than traditional models convey, and that the movement of receptors and coactivators is remarkably dynamic. Transcription factors are highly mobile in the nuclear environment, and interact only briefly with target sites in the nucleus. As a result of these transient interactions, promoters move through many states during activation and repression. Two general concepts emerge from current data: (1) Various transcription factors appear to follow "ordered recruitment" to promoters on a time scale of minutes to hours in response to a stimulus. During this response, the proteins that interact with chromatin may cycle on and off the promoter multiple times. (2) During these ordered recruitment cycles, the individual molecules that form functional complexes often exchange rapidly on a time scale of seconds. This rapid exchange of molecules within a formed complex occurs independently of long-term cycling on chromatin. Several processes are implicated in rapid nuclear dynamics, including potential roles for molecular chaperones, the proteasome degradation machinery and chromatin remodeling complexes.},

abstract = {DNA damage initiates a series of p53 pulses. Although much is known about the interactions surrounding p53, little is known about which interactions contribute to p53's dynamical behavior. The simplest explanation is that these pulses are oscillations intrinsic to the p53/Mdm2 negative feedback loop. Here we present evidence that this simple mechanism is insufficient to explain p53 pulses; we show that p53 pulses are externally driven by pulses in the upstream signaling kinases, ATM and Chk2, and that the negative feedback between p53 and ATM, via Wip1, is essential for maintaining the uniform shape of p53 pulses. We propose that p53 pulses result from repeated initiation by ATM, which is reactivated by persistent DNA damage. Our study emphasizes the importance of collecting quantitative dynamic information at high temporal resolution for understanding the regulation of signaling pathways and opens new ways to manipulate p53 pulses to ask questions about their function in response to DNA damage.},

@article{Miller2011,
abstract = {To obtain rates of mRNA synthesis and decay in yeast, we established dynamic transcriptome analysis (DTA). DTA combines non-perturbing metabolic RNA labeling with dynamic kinetic modeling. DTA reveals that most mRNA synthesis rates are around several transcripts per cell and cell cycle, and most mRNA half-lives range around a median of 11 min. DTA can monitor the cellular response to osmotic stress with higher sensitivity and temporal resolution than standard transcriptomics. In contrast to monotonically increasing total mRNA levels, DTA reveals three phases of the stress response. During the initial shock phase, mRNA synthesis and decay rates decrease globally, resulting in mRNA storage. During the subsequent induction phase, both rates increase for a subset of genes, resulting in production and rapid removal of stress-responsive mRNAs. During the recovery phase, decay rates are largely restored, whereas synthesis rates remain altered, apparently enabling growth at high salt concentration. Stress-induced changes in mRNA synthesis rates are predicted from gene occupancy with RNA polymerase II. DTA-derived mRNA synthesis rates identified 16 stress-specific pairs/triples of cooperative transcription factors, of which seven were known. Thus, DTA realistically monitors the dynamics in mRNA metabolism that underlie gene regulatory systems.},

@article{Hornberg2006,
abstract = {Cancer research has focused on the identification of molecular differences between cancerous and healthy cells. The emerging picture is overwhelmingly complex. Molecules out of many parallel signal transduction pathways are involved. Their activities appear to be controlled by multiple factors. The action of regulatory circuits, cross-talk between pathways and the non-linear reaction kinetics of biochemical processes complicate the understanding and prediction of the outcome of intracellular signaling. In addition, interactions between tumor and other cell types give rise to a complex supra-cellular communication network. If cancer is such a complex system, how can one ever predict the effect of a mutation in a particular gene on a functionality of the entire system? And, how should one go about identifying drug targets? Here, we argue that one aspect is to recognize, where the essence resides, i.e. recognize cancer as a Systems Biology disease. Then, more cancer biologists could become systems biologists aiming to provide answers to some of the above systemic questions. To this aim, they should integrate the available knowledge stemming from quantitative experimental results through mathematical models. Models that have contributed to the understanding of complex biological systems are discussed. We show that the architecture of a signaling network is important for determining the site at which an oncologist should intervene. Finally, we discuss the possibility of applying network-based drug design to cancer treatment and how rationalized therapies, such as the application of kinase inhibitors, may benefit from Systems Biology.},

We discuss the similar mechanisms and requirements shared by computational and biological processes and then present several recent studies that apply this joint analysis strategy to problems related to coordination, network analysis, and tracking and vision. We also discuss additional biological processes that can be studied in a similar manner and link them to potential computational problems.

abstract = {The regulation of cellular protein levels is a complex process involving many regulatory mechanisms, each introducing stochastic events, leading to variability of protein levels between isogenic cells. Previous studies have shown that perturbing genes involved in transcription regulation affects the amount of cell-to-cell variability in protein levels, but to date there has been no systematic characterization of variability in expression as a phenotype. In this research, we use single-cell expression levels of two fluorescent reporters driven by two different promoters under a wide range of genetic perturbations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to identify proteins that affect variability in the expression of these reporters. We introduce computational methodology to determine the variability caused by each perturbation and distinguish between global variability, which affects both reporters in a coordinated manner (e.g., due to cell size variability), and local variability, which affects the individual reporters independently (e.g., due to stochastic events in transcription initiation). Classifying genes by their variability phenotype (the effect of their deletion on reporter variability) identifies functionally coherent groups, which broadly correlate with the different stages of transcriptional regulation. Specifically, we find that most processes whose perturbation affects global variability are related to protein synthesis, protein transport, and cell morphology, whereas most processes whose perturbations affect local variability are related to DNA maintenance, chromatin regulation, and RNA synthesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the variability phenotypes of different protein complexes provide insights into their cellular functions. Our results establish the utility of variability phenotype for dissecting the regulatory mechanisms involved in gene expression.},

abstract = {Phytoestrogens are a chemically diverse group of compounds made by plants that can have estrogenic effects in animals. Both tumorigenic and antitumorigenic effects have been reported. Although estrogens stimulate the growth of many breast tumors, there is a negative correlation between the incidence of breast cancer and the phytoestrogen-rich diet of certain Asian populations. To begin to resolve this paradox, we have analyzed the estrogenic properties of genistein and quercetin, two flavonoid phytoestrogens particularly abundant in soybeans. Trans-activation experiments with a transfected reporter gene for nuclear estrogen receptors (ER) show strong activation of the endogenous ER alpha by both phytoestrogens in two MCF7 human breast cancer cell lines. This is supported by the observation that the two phytoestrogens induce the down-regulation of ER alpha mRNA and protein levels. Using chimeric proteins consisting of the hormone binding domains of ER alpha and ER beta fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, we have established that genistein and quercetin are full estrogenic agonists of both ER isoforms. Ligand binding experiments with purified ER alpha and ER beta confirm that the two phytoestrogens are ER ligands. At concentrations that are sufficient to obtain substantial transcriptional activity, they stimulate the proliferation of two ER alpha-dependent breast cancer cell lines. At high concentrations, such as those reached with a soy-rich diet, genistein and quercetin are strong cytotoxic agents that even kill ER-independent HeLa cells. Thus, the mode of action of phytoestrogens and the balance between being risk or chemopreventive factors for breast cancer may depend on the dietary load.},

These waves are generated by an interplay between random diffusion of cyclic AMP in the extracellular milieu and the signal-reception/signal/relaying capabilities of individual amoebae. Kinetic properties of the enzymes, transport proteins and cell-surface receptor proteins involved in the cyclic AMP signaling system have been painstakingly worked out over the past fifteen years in many laboratories. Recently Martiel \{\&\} Goldbeter (1987) incorporated this biochemical information into a unified mathematical model of communication among Dictyostelium amoebae. Numerical simulations of the mathematical model, carried out by Tyson et al. (1989), agree in quantitative detail with experimental observations of cyclic AMP traveling waves in Dictyostelium cultures. Such mathematical modeling and numerical experimentation provide a necessary link between detailed studies of the molecular control mechanism and experimental observations of the intact developmental system.},

@article{Wee2012a,
abstract = {Intracellular protein levels of diverse transcription factors (TFs) vary periodically with time. However, the effects of TF oscillations on gene expression, the primary role of TFs, are poorly understood. In this study, we determined these effects by comparing gene expression levels induced in the presence and in the absence of TF oscillations under same mean intracellular protein level of TF. For all the nonlinear TF transcription kinetics studied, an oscillatory TF is predicted to induce gene expression levels that are distinct from a nonoscillatory TF. The conditions dictating whether TF oscillations induce either higher or lower average gene expression levels were elucidated. Subsequently, the predicted effects from an oscillatory TF, which follows sigmoid transcription kinetics, were applied to demonstrate how oscillatory dynamics provide a mechanism for differential target gene transactivation. Generally, the mean TF concentration at which oscillations occur relative to the promoter binding affinity of a target gene determines whether the gene is up- or downregulated whereas the oscillation amplitude amplifies the magnitude of the differential regulation. Notably, the predicted trends of differential gene expressions induced by oscillatory NF-$\kappa$B and glucocorticoid receptor match the reported experimental observations. Furthermore, the biological function of p53 oscillations is predicted to prime the cell for death upon DNA damage via differential upregulation of apoptotic genes. Lastly, given N target genes, an oscillatory TF can generate between (N - 1) and (2N - 1) distinct patterns of differential transactivation. This study provides insights into the mechanism for TF oscillations to induce differential gene expressions, and underscores the importance of TF oscillations in biological regulations.},

Mathematical models, tightly linked to experiment, have been instrumental in unraveling the forms of regulation in NF-kappaB signaling and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Our initial model of the IkappaB-NF-kappaB signaling module highlighted the role of negative feedback in the control of NF-kappaB temporal dynamics and gene expression. Subsequent studies sparked by this work have helped to characterize additional feedback loops, the input-output behavior of the module, crosstalk between multiple NF-kappaB-activating pathways, and NF-kappaB oscillations. We anticipate that computational techniques will enable further progress in the NF-kappaB field, and the signal transduction field in general, and we discuss potential upcoming developments.},

Here we discuss the apparent discrepancy between the classic sequential assembly model based mostly on biochemistry and an emerging dynamic assembly model based mostly on fluorescence microscopy. The former model favors a stable transcription complex with subunits that cooperatively assemble in order, whereas the latter model favors an unstable complex with subunits that may assemble more randomly. To confront this apparent discrepancy, we review the merits and drawbacks of the different experimental approaches and list potential biasing factors that could be responsible for the different interpretations of assembly. We then discuss how these biases might be overcome in the future with improved experiments or new techniques. Finally, we discuss how kinetic models for assembly may help resolve the ordered and stable vs. random and dynamic assembly debate.},

The polar distribution of Cdc42 in this assay required targeted secretion directed by the actin cytoskeleton. A mathematical simulation showed that a stable polarity axis could be generated through a positive feedback loop in which a stochastic increase in the local concentration of activated Cdc42 on the plasma membrane enhanced the probability of actin polymerization and increased the probability of further Cdc42 accumulation to that site.},

abstract = {In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, interphase microtubules (MTs) position the nucleus [1, 2], which in turn positions the cell-division plane [1, 3]. It is unclear how the spindle orients, with respect to the predetermined division plane, to ensure that the chromosomes are segregated across this plane. It has been proposed that, during prometaphase, the astral MT interaction with the cell cortex aligns the spindle with the cell axis [4] and also participates in a spindle orientation checkpoint (SOC), which delays entry into anaphase as long as the spindle is misaligned [5-7]. Here, we trace the position of the spindle throughout mitosis in a single-cell assay. We find no evidence for the SOC. We show that the spindle is remarkably well aligned with the cell longitudinal axis at the onset of mitosis, by growing along the axis of the adjacent interphase MT. Misalignment of nascent spindles can give rise to anucleate cells when spindle elongation is impaired. We propose a new role for interphase microtubules: through interaction with the spindle pole body, interphase microtubules determine the initial alignment of the spindle in the subsequent cell division.},

abstract = {Cellular messenger RNA levels are achieved by the combinatorial complexity of factors controlling transcription, yet the small number of molecules involved in these pathways fluctuates stochastically. It has not yet been experimentally possible to observe the activity of single polymerases on an endogenous gene to elucidate how these events occur in vivo. Here, we describe a method of fluctuation analysis of fluorescently labeled RNA to measure dynamics of nascent RNA--including initiation, elongation, and termination--at an active yeast locus. We find no transcriptional memory between initiation events, and elongation speed can vary by threefold throughout the cell cycle. By measuring the abundance and intranuclear mobility of an upstream transcription factor, we observe that the gene firing rate is directly determined by trans-activating factor search times.},

By measuring the cycling expression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 gene in human cells, we constructed a detailed stochastic model for single-gene transcription at the molecular level using realistic kinetics for diffusion and protein complex dynamics. We observed that gene induction caused an approximate 60 min periodicity of several transcription related processes: first, the covalent histone modifications and presence of many regulatory proteins at the transcription start site; second, RNA polymerase II activity; third, chromatin loop formation; and fourth, mRNA accumulation. Our model can predict the precise timing of single-gene activity leading to transcriptional cycling on the cell population level when we take into account the sequential and irreversible multistep nature of transcriptional initiation. We propose that the cyclic nature of population gene expression is primarily based on the intrinsic periodicity of the transcription process itself.},

abstract = {During mitosis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kar9p directs one spindle pole body (SPB) toward the incipient daughter cell by linking the associated set of cytoplasmic microtubules (cMTs) to the polarized actin network on the bud cortex. The asymmetric localization of Kar9p to one SPB and attached cMTs is dependent on its interactions with microtubule-associated proteins and is regulated by the yeast Cdk1 Cdc28p. Two phosphorylation sites in Kar9p were previously identified. Here, we propose that the two sites are likely to govern Kar9p function through separate mechanisms, each involving a distinct cyclin. In the first mechanism, phosphorylation at serine 496 recruits Kar9p to one SPB. A phosphomimetic mutation at serine 496 bypasses the requirement of BIK1 and CLB5 in generating Kar9p asymmetry. In the second mechanism, Clb4p may target serine 197 of Kar9p for phosphorylation. This modification is required for Kar9p to direct cMTs to the bud. Two-hybrid analysis suggests that this phosphorylation may attenuate the interaction between Kar9p and the XMAP215-homologue Stu2p. We propose that phosphorylation at serine 197 regulates the release of Kar9p from Stu2p at the SPB, either to clear it from the mother-SPB or to allow it to travel to the plus end.},

abstract = {The coordination of biological activities into daily cycles provides an important advantage for the fitness of diverse organisms. Thereby, an internal circadian oscillator drives gene expression in an approximate 24 hours rhythm. Circadian clocks are found in most eukaryotes. In prokaryotes only cyanobacteria are known to regulate their activities in a circadian rhythm. In vitro experiments showed that three cyanobacterial proteins KaiA, KaiB and KaiC together with ATP are sufficient to generate temperature-compensated circadian oscillations of KaiC protein phosphorylation. Thus, in contrast to eukaryotic clock models the cyanobacterial core oscillator operates independently of transcription and translation processes. Most previous models of the bacterial circadian clock used complex mathematical descriptions. Here, we suggest a minimal and manageable heuristic system. Even though only four reaction steps were assumed, our model exhibited sustained oscillations of KaiC phosphorylation. A simulation of known experimental data was successful as well as oscillations maintained even for a concerted increase of Kai protein concentration. Thus, we provided a useful minimal system of differential equations which might serve as a core module of the holistic cyanobacterial clockwork in the future.},

abstract = {This article introduces the finite state projection (FSP) method for use in the stochastic analysis of chemically reacting systems. One can describe the chemical populations of such systems with probability density vectors that evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME). Unlike Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) or tau leaping, the FSP directly solves or approximates the solution of the CME. If the CME describes a system that has a finite number of distinct population vectors, the FSP method provides an exact analytical solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of population variations is possible, the state space can be truncated, and the FSP method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the truncated space approximation matches the true solution. The proposed FSP algorithm systematically increases the projection space in order to meet prespecified tolerance in the total probability density error. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate FSP exists, the FSP algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The FSP is utilized to solve two examples taken from the field of systems biology, and comparisons are made between the FSP, the SSA, and tau leaping algorithms. In both examples, the FSP outperforms the SSA in terms of accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Furthermore, due to very small molecular counts in these particular examples, the FSP also performs far more effectively than tau leaping methods.},

Beh, M. Latterich, R. Schekman, and M.D. Rose. 1994. J. Cell Biol. 126:911-923.). We now report a general defect in nuclear migration and microtubule orientation in kar9 mutants. KAR9 encodes a novel 74-kD protein that is not essential for life. The kar9 mitotic defect was similar to mutations in dhc1/dyn1 (dynein heavy chain gene), jnm1, and act5. kar9Delta dhc1Delta, kar9Delta jnm1Delta, and kar9Delta act5Delta double mutants were synthetically lethal, suggesting that these genes function in partially redundant pathways to carry out nuclear migration. A functional GFP-Kar9p fusion protein localized to a single dot at the tip of the shmoo projection. In mitotic cells, GFP-Kar9p localized to a cortical dot with both mother-daughter asymmetry and cell cycle dependence. In small-budded cells through anaphase, GFP-Kar9p was found at the tip of the growing bud. In telophase and G1 unbudded cells, no localization was observed. By indirect immunofluorescence, cytoplasmic microtubules intersected the GFP-Kar9p dot. Nocodazole experiments demonstrated that Kar9p's cortical localization was microtubule independent. We propose that Kar9p is a component of a cortical adaptor complex that orients cytoplasmic microtubules.},

abstract = {Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an excellent organism for studying microtubule dynamics owing to the presence of well-defined microtubule arrays that undergo dramatic rearrangements during various stages of the cell cycle. Using sensitive time-lapse video microscopy and kymographic analysis, we have determined the polymerization/depolymerization kinetics of individual microtubules within these arrays throughout the fission yeast cell cycle. Interphase bundles are composed of 4-7 microtubules that act autonomously, demonstrating that individual microtubules are responsible for mediating the functions ascribed to these arrays. The nucleation and growth of cytoplasmic microtubules is inhibited upon cellular transition into mitosis, leading to their gradual disappearance. At the onset of mitosis, microtubules form on the nuclear face of the spindle pole body and exhibit dramatically increased dynamics. The presence of these intra-nuclear astral microtubules (INA) is reminiscent of spindle assembly and the search and chromosome capture mechanism observed in metazoan cells. Consistent with other in vivo studies, we do not observe microtubule flux in the anaphase B spindle. Finally, the depolymerization of individual microtubules alternates between each half-spindle, resulting in spindle collapse during telophase. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that microtubules in these diverse cytoskeletal arrays have autonomous behaviors that are an essential component of any model describing cell-cycle-dependent changes in the behavior and function of microtubule arrays.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a growing interest in computational discovery of regulatory elements, and a multitude of motif discovery methods have been proposed. Computational motif discovery has been used with some success in simple organisms like yeast. However, as we move to higher organisms with more complex genomes, more sensitive methods are needed. Several recent methods try to integrate additional sources of information, including microarray experiments (gene expression and ChlP-chip). There is also a growing awareness that regulatory elements work in combination, and that this combinatorial behavior must be modeled for successful motif discovery. However, the multitude of methods and approaches makes it difficult to get a good understanding of the current status of the field. RESULTS: This paper presents a survey of methods for motif discovery in DNA, based on a structured and well defined framework that integrates all relevant elements. Existing methods are discussed according to this framework. CONCLUSION: The survey shows that although no single method takes all relevant elements into consideration, a very large number of different models treating the various elements separately have been tried. Very often the choices that have been made are not explicitly stated, making it difficult to compare different implementations. Also, the tests that have been used are often not comparable. Therefore, a stringent framework and improved test methods are needed to evaluate the different approaches in order to conclude which ones are most promising. Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Eugene V. Koonin, Philipp Bucher (nominated by Mikhail Gelfand) and Frank Eisenhaber.},

abstract = {The development of epigenetic therapies fuels cancer hope. DNA-methylation inhibitors, histone-deacetylase and histone-methyltransferase (HMTase) inhibitors are being developed as the utilization of epigenetic targets is emerging as an effective and valuable approach to chemotherapy as well as chemoprevention of cancer. The nuclear receptor binding SET domain (NSD) protein is a family of three HMTases, NSD1, NSD2/MMSET/WHSC1, and NSD3/WHSC1L1 that are critical in maintaining the chromatin integrity. A growing number of studies have reported alterations or amplifications of NSD1, NSD2, or NSD3 in numerous carcinogenic events. Reducing NSDs activity through specific lysine-HMTase inhibitors appears promising to help suppressing cancer growth. However, little is known about the NSD pathways and our understanding of the histone lysine-HMTase mechanism is partial. To shed some light on both the recognition and the regulation of epigenetic marks by the SET domain of the NSD family, we investigate the structural mechanisms of the docking of the histone-H4 tail on the SET domain of NSD1. Our finding exposes a key regulatory and recognition mechanism driven by the flexibility of a loop at the interface of the SET and postSET region. Finally, we prospect the special value of this regulatory region for developing specific and selective NSD inhibitors for the epigenetic therapy of cancers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular evolutionary studies of noncoding sequences rely on multiple alignments. Yet how multiple alignment accuracy varies across sequence types, tree topologies, divergences and tools, and further how this variation impacts specific inferences, remains unclear. RESULTS: Here we develop a molecular evolution simulation platform, CisEvolver, with models of background noncoding and transcription factor binding site evolution, and use simulated alignments to systematically examine multiple alignment accuracy and its impact on two key molecular evolutionary inferences: transcription factor binding site conservation and divergence estimation. We find that the accuracy of multiple alignments is determined almost exclusively by the pairwise divergence distance of the two most diverged species and that additional species have a negligible influence on alignment accuracy. Conserved transcription factor binding sites align better than surrounding noncoding DNA yet are often found to be misaligned at relatively short divergence distances, such that studies of binding site gain and loss could easily be confounded by alignment error. Divergence estimates from multiple alignments tend to be overestimated at short divergence distances but reach a tool specific divergence at which they cease to increase, leading to underestimation at long divergences. Our most striking finding was that overall alignment accuracy, binding site alignment accuracy and divergence estimation accuracy vary greatly across branches in a tree and are most accurate for terminal branches connecting sister taxa and least accurate for internal branches connecting sub-alignments. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that variation in alignment accuracy can lead to errors in molecular evolutionary inferences that could be construed as biological variation. These findings have implications for which species to choose for analyses, what kind of errors would be expected for a given set of species and how multiple alignment tools and phylogenetic inference methods might be improved to minimize or control for alignment errors.},

abstract = {Abstract. The arcsine square root transformation has long been standard procedure when analyzing proportional data in ecology, with applications in data sets containing binomial and non-binomial response variables. Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

The criterion of maximizing the concordance may not be appropriate in certain applications. In practice, some applications may emphasize high sensitivity (e.g., clinical diagnostic tests) and others may emphasize high specificity (e.g., epidemiology screening studies). This paper considers effects of the decision threshold on sensitivity, specificity, and concordance for four classification methods: logistic regression, classification tree, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, and a weighted k-nearest neighbor. We investigated the use of decision threshold adjustment to improve performance of either sensitivity or specificity of a classifier under specific conditions. We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation showing that as the decision threshold increases, the sensitivity decreases and the specificity increases; but, the concordance values in an interval around the maximum concordance are similar. For specified sensitivity and specificity levels, an optimal decision threshold might be determined in an interval around the maximum concordance that meets the specified requirement. Three example data sets were analyzed for illustrations.},

However, the data in real-world applications often are imbalanced class distribution, that is, most of the data are in majority class and little data are in minority class. In this case, if all the data are used to be the training data, the classifier tends to predict that most of the incoming data belongs to the majority class. Hence, it is important to select the suitable training data for classification in the imbalanced class distribution problem. In this paper, we propose cluster-based under-sampling approaches for selecting the representative data as training data to improve the classification accuracy for minority class and investigate the effect of under-sampling methods in the imbalanced class distribution environment.

These levels have been accepted unquestioned from publications in social sciences dating from the 1940s and 1950s. The Stevens taxonomy has been used to prescribe appropriate symbolism (or analytical treatment) to each scale of measurement. This paper reviews the process by which these levels became a part of cartography, as well as subsequent literature that cartographers have all but ignored over the intervening four decades. The paper concludes that the four levels of measurement are not adequate to cover the circumstances of cartography, and that attribute issues alone do not provide a sufficient guide to symbolism or analytical treatment. A broader framework for measurement must be considered, including the relationships of control that constrain variation in one component to permit measurement of another. An informed use of tools does not depend on numbers alone, but on the whole “measurement framework,” the system of objects, relationships and axioms implied by a given system of representation.},

When class sizes are unequal the performance of some of these methods may be biased according to class size.

abstract = {This article develops an effective procedure for handling two-class classification problems with highly imbalanced class sizes. In many imbalanced two-class problems, the majority class represents “normal” cases, while the minority class represents “abnormal” cases, detection of which is critical to decision making. When the class sizes are highly imbalanced, conventional classification methods tend to strongly favor the majority class, resulting in very low or even no detection of the minority class. The research objective of this article is to devise a systematic procedure to substantially improve the power of detecting the minority class so that the resulting procedure can help screen the original data set and select a much smaller subset for further investigation. A procedure is developed that is based on ensemble classifiers, where each classifier is constructed from a resized training set with reduced dimension space. In addition, how to find the best values of the decision variables in the proposed classification procedure is specified. The proposed method is compared to a set of off-the-shelf classification methods using two real data sets. The prediction results of the proposed method show remarkable improvements over the other methods. The proposed method can detect about 75\% of the minority class units, while the other methods turn out much lower detection rates.},

However, their usefulness in real-world multi-class problems has not been demonstrated yet. In these frequently occurring multi-class cases, simple accuracy meters that do compensate for random successes, such as the kappa statistic, are needed. ROC curves are two-dimensional graphs. Kappa is a scalar. Each comes from an entirely different discipline. This research investigates whether they do have anything in common. A mathematical formulation that links ROC spaces with the kappa statistic is derived here for the first time. The understanding of how these two accuracy meters relate to each other can assist in a better understanding of their respective pros and cons.},

@article{Leonard2006,
abstract = {The development of predictive QSAR models depends not only on the statistical method but also on the algorithm used for the selection of training and test sets. Here, we describe the validation of QSAR models for three data sets with different sizes (n = 35, 56 and 87) based on random division, sorted biological activity data and K-meam clusters for the factor scores of the original variable matrix along with/without biological activity values. When the training and test sets were generated by random division or by the activity-range algorithm, predictive models were not obtained in most of the cases. In case of random division of the data sets into training and test sets, there is no correlation between internal and external validation statistics. However, good external validation statistics were obtained when training and test sets were selected based on K-means clusters of factor scores of the descriptor space along with/without the biological activity values. So, the selection of training and test sets should be based on the proximity of the representative points of the test set to representative points of the training set in the multidimensional descriptor space. The concept of closeness is based on the general assumption underlying all QSAR theories: similar compounds have similar activities. Thus, if one wishes to validate a QSAR model, the points of the test set must be close to the points of the training set in the multidimensional descriptor space. Based on the results of several methods for the division of the training and test sets, we propose that K-means-cluster- based division of training and prediction sets can be used as a reliable method of division of data set into training and test sets for developing predictive QSAR models. 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Regression tends to give very unstable and unreliable regression weights when predictors are highly collinear. Several methods have been proposed to counter this problem. A subset of these do so by finding components that summarize the information in the predictors and the criterion variables. The present paper compares six such methods (two of which are almost completely new) to ordinary regression: Partial least Squares (PLS), Principal Component regression (PCR), Principle covariates regression, reduced rank regression, and two variants of what is called power regression. The comparison is mainly done by means of a series of simulation studies, in which data are constructed in various ways, with different degrees of collinearity and noise, and the methods are compared in terms of their capability of recovering the population regression weights, as well as their prediction quality for the complete population. It turns out that recovery of regression weights in situations with collinearity is often very poor by all methods, unless the regression weights lie in the subspace spanning the first few principal components of the predictor variables. In those cases, typically PLS and PCR give the best recoveries of regression weights. The picture is inconclusive, however, because, especially in the study with more real life like simulated data, PLS and PCR gave the poorest recoveries of regression weights in conditions with relatively low noise and collinearity. It seems that PLS and PCR are particularly indicated in cases with much collinearity, whereas in other cases it is better to use ordinary regression. As far as prediction is concerned: Prediction suffers far less from collinearity than recovery of the regression weights.},

@article{Altmann2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of the viral genome for drug resistance mutations is state-of-the-art for guiding treatment selection for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients. These mutations alter the structure of viral target proteins and reduce or in the worst case completely inhibit the effect of antiretroviral compounds while maintaining the ability for effective replication. Modern anti-HIV-1 regimens comprise multiple drugs in order to prevent or at least delay the development of resistance mutations. However, commonly used HIV-1 genotype interpretation systems provide only classifications for single drugs. The EuResist initiative has collected data from about 18,500 patients to train three classifiers for predicting response to combination antiretroviral therapy, given the viral genotype and further information. In this work we compare different classifier fusion methods for combining the individual classifiers. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The individual classifiers yielded similar performance, and all the combination approaches considered performed equally well. The gain in performance due to combining methods did not reach statistical significance compared to the single best individual classifier on the complete training set. However, on smaller training set sizes (200 to 1,600 instances compared to 2,700) the combination significantly outperformed the individual classifiers (p<0.01; paired one-sided Wilcoxon test). Together with a consistent reduction of the standard deviation compared to the individual prediction engines this shows a more robust behavior of the combined system. Moreover, using the combined system we were able to identify a class of therapy courses that led to a consistent underestimation (about 0.05 AUC) of the system performance. Discovery of these therapy courses is a further hint for the robustness of the combined system. CONCLUSION: The combined EuResist prediction engine is freely available at http://engine.euresist.org.},

abstract = {1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

The aim of these models is often to estimate fixed effects and to test their significance. This is usually done by including random intercepts, that is, intercepts that are allowed to vary between individuals. The widespread belief is that this controls for all types of pseudoreplication within individuals. Here we show that this is not the case, if the aim is to estimate effects that vary within individuals and individuals differ in their response to these effects. In these cases, random intercept models give overconfident estimates leading to conclusions that are not supported by the data. By allowing individuals to differ in the slopes of their responses, it is possible to account for the nonindependence of data points that pseudoreplicate slope information. Such random slope models give appropriate standard errors and are easily implemented in standard statistical software. Because random slope models are not always used where they are essential, we suspect that many published findings have too narrow confidence intervals and a substantially inflated type I error rate. Besides reducing type I errors, random slope models have the potential to reduce residual variance by accounting for between-individual variation in slopes, which makes it easier to detect treatment effects that are applied between individuals, hence reducing type II errors as well.},

abstract = {There has been a great deal of interest in recent years in fitting logistic and log-linear models to tables of population counts estimated from survey data. Since maximum likelihood methods are not available in general for complex survey designs, most work has concentrated on adapting standard methods developed for multinominal sampling. Maximum likelihood methods have been developed for some special designs, however, and we might expect ad hoc methods to be less efficient in these cases. We compare the two approaches in the important special case of fitting logistic regression models under case-control or choice-based sampling, where the population is stratified by values of the (categorical) response variable.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen an increase in the number of regression problems for which the predictor and/or response arrays have orders higher than two, i.e. multiway data. Examples are found in, e.g. industrial batch process analysis, chemical calibration using second-order instrumentation and quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR). As these types of problems increase in complexity in terms of both the dimensions and the underlying structures of the data sets, the number of options with respect to different types of scaling and regression models also increases. In this article, three methods for multiway regression are compared: unfold partial least squares (PLS), multilinear PLS and multiway covariates regression (MCovR). All three methods differ either in the structural model imposed on the data or the way the model components are calculated. Three methods of scaling multiway arrays are also compared, along with the option of applying no scaling. Three data sets drawn from industrial processes are used in the comparison. The general conclusion is that the type of data and scaling used is more important than the type of regression model used in terms of predictive ability. The models do differ, however, in terms of interpretability.},

Inhalable particles, separated in PM2.5 and coarse particulate mode (CPM, with size in the range (2.5<dp<10 [mu]m)), were sampled from April 1997 to March 1998 and analyzed for BC, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Zr, Pb. The average concentrations of PM2.5, CPM, BC and chemical elements were statistically higher in the dry season than in the wet season. The results of absolute principal component analysis showed four and three different sources for PM2.5 and CPM, respectively. Sugar-cane burning is the main source of PM2.5 representing 60\% of PM2.5, soil dust accounted for 14\%, and industries and oil combustion contributed with 12\% each one. Resuspended soil is the main source of CPM followed by industrial emissions and sugar-cane burning. The sampling and analytical procedures applied in this study showed that sugar-cane burning and agricultural practices are the main sources of inhalable particles, possibly altering the aerosol composition around the city of Piracicaba.},

abstract = {Modern institutions face the recurring dilemma of designing accurate evaluation procedures in settings as diverse as academic selection committees, social policies, elections, and figure skating competitions. In particular, it is essential to determine both the number of evaluators and the method for combining their judgments. Previous work has focused on the latter issue, uncovering paradoxes that underscore the inherent difficulties. Yet the number of judges is an important consideration that is intimately connected with the methodology and the success of the evaluation. We address the question of the number of judges through a cost analysis that incorporates the accuracy of the evaluation method, the cost per judge, and the cost of an error in decision. We associate the optimal number of judges with the lowest cost and determine the optimal number of judges in several different scenarios. Through analytical and numerical studies, we show how the optimal number depends on the evaluation rule, the accuracy of the judges, the (cost per judge)/(cost per error) ratio. Paradoxically, we find that for a panel of judges of equal accuracy, the optimal panel size may be greater for judges with higher accuracy than for judges with lower accuracy. The development of any evaluation procedure requires knowledge about the accuracy of evaluation methods, the costs of judges, and the costs of errors. By determining the optimal number of judges, we highlight important connections between these quantities and uncover a paradox that we show to be a general feature of evaluation procedures. Ultimately, our work provides policy-makers with a simple and novel method to optimize evaluation procedures.},

abstract = {While building a predictive quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), validation of the developed model is a very important task. However, a truly new set of data being often unavailable for checking predictability and robustness of the developed model, a typical external validation in QSAR studies is commonly performed by splitting the available data into training and test sets. In the present work we have attempted to explore the impact of training set size on the quality of prediction using different topological descriptors and three different statistical techniques. Three different data sets of moderate size have been used for the present study: cytoprotection data of anti-HIV thiocarbamates (n = 62), HIV reverse transcriptase inhibition data of 1-(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl-6-(phenylthio)thymine (HEPT) derivatives (n = 107) and bioconcentration factor data of diverse functional compounds (n = 122). In each case, the data set was divided into different combinations of training and test sets maintaining different size ratios in several iterations. In cases of the first two data sets, significant impact of reduction of training set size was found on the predictive ability of the models while the first data set showing higher dependence on the size than the second one. However, in case of modeling of bioconcentration factor, no significant impact of training set size on the quality of prediction could be found. Hence, no general rule can be formulated regarding the impact of training set size on the quality of prediction. Optimum size of the training set should be set based on a particular data set and types of descriptors and statistical analysis being used. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {Stevens’ theory of admissible statistics [Stevens, S. S. (1946). On the theory of scales of measurement. Science, 103, 677680] states that measurement levels should guide the choice of statistical test, such that the truth value of statements based on a statistical analysis remains invariant under admissible transformations of the data. Lord [Lord, F. M. (1953). On the statistical treatment of football numbers. American Psychologist, 8, 750–751] challenged this theory. In a thought experiment, a parametric test is performed on football numbers (identifying players: a nominal representation) to decide whether a sample from the machine issuing these numbers should be considered non-random. This is an apparently illegal test, since its outcomes are not invariant under admissible transformations for the nominal measurement level. Nevertheless, it results in a sensible conclusion: the number-issuing machine was tampered with. In the ensuing measurement-statistics debate Lord’s contribution has been influential, but has also led to much confusion. The present aim is to show that the thought experiment contains a serious flaw. First it is shown that the implicit assumption that the numbers are nominal is false. This disqualifies Lord’s argument as a valid counterexample to Stevens’ dictum. Second, it is argued that the football numbers do not represent just the nominal property of non-identity of the players; they also represent the amount of bias in the machine. It is a question about this property–not a property that relates to the identity of the football players–that the statistical test is concerned with. Therefore, only this property is relevant to Lord’s argument. We argue that the level of bias in the machine, indicated by the population mean, conforms to a bisymmetric structure, which means that it lies on an interval scale. In this light, Lord’s thought experiment–interpreted by many as a problematic counterexample to Stevens’ theory of admissible statistics–conforms perfectly to Stevens’ dictum.},

An analysis shows that this occurs because the computed net error gradient vector is dominated by the bigger class so much that the net error for the exemplars in the smaller class increases significantly in the initial iteration. The subsequent rate of convergence of the net error is very low. A modified technique for calculating a direction in weight-space which decreases the error for each class is presented. Using this algorithm, the rate of learning for two-class classification problems is accelerated by an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Principal components analysis of genetic data is used to avoid inflation in type I error rates in association testing due to population stratification by covariate adjustment using the top eigenvectors and to estimate cluster or group membership independent of self-reported or ethnic identities. Eigendecomposition transforms correlated variables into an equal number of uncorrelated variables. Numerous stopping rules have been developed to identify which principal components should be retained. Recent developments in random matrix theory have led to a formal hypothesis test of the top eigenvalue, providing another way to achieve dimension reduction. In this study, I compare Velicer's minimum average partial test to a test on the basis of Tracy-Widom distribution as implemented in EIGENSOFT, the most widely used implementation of principal components analysis in genome-wide association analysis. By computer simulation of vicariance on the basis of coalescent theory, EIGENSOFT systematically overestimates the number of significant principal components. Furthermore, this overestimation is larger for samples of admixed individuals than for samples of unadmixed individuals. Overestimating the number of significant principal components can potentially lead to a loss of power in association testing by adjusting for unnecessary covariates and may lead to incorrect inferences about group differentiation. Velicer's minimum average partial test is shown to have both smaller bias and smaller variance, often with a mean squared error of 0, in estimating the number of principal components to retain. Velicer's minimum average partial test is implemented in R code and is suitable for genome-wide genotype data with or without population labels.Heredity advance online publication, 30 March 2011; doi:10.1038/hdy.2011.26.},

abstract = {Five methods for discrimination are described, namely Euclidean Distance to centroids (EDC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (based on the Mahalanobis distance and pooled variance covariance matrix), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) (based on the Mahalanobis distance and individual class variance covariance matrix — non-Bayesian form), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (using soft boundaries and Radial Basis Functions), and illustrated graphically as boundary methods. The performance of each method was determined using four synthetic datasets each consisting of 200 samples half belonging to one of two classes, and a further two synthetic datasets containing 400 samples, again equally split between the two classes. In datasets 1 to 3, five variables were distributed multinormally, in dataset 1 the classes are distributed roughly circularly but with a significant degree of overlap, in dataset 2, the distribution is in elongated hyperellipsoids with small overlap, and in dataset 3 there is a region of complete overlap between classes. In dataset 4 two variables are distributed in a crescent shape. In datasets 5 and 6, 100 variables were generated from multinormal populations, some of which were potential discriminators, however a large proportion of the variables were designed to be uninformative. The methods were optimised using a training set and their performance evaluated using a test set: this was repeated 100 times for different test and training set splits. The average \% correctly classified was computed for each class and model, as well as the model stability for each sample (the proportion of times the sample is classified into the same group over all 100 iterations). The conclusions are that the performance of the classifiers depends very much on the distribution of data. Approaches such as LVQ and SVMs that try to determine complex boundaries perform best when the data is not normally distributed such as in dataset 4, but can be prone to overfitting otherwise. QDA tends to perform best on multinormal data although it can be influenced by non-discriminative variables which show a difference in variance. It is recommended to look at the data structure prior to model building to determine the optimal type of model.},

Computer simulations integrating knowledge of organ and system-level responses help prioritize targets and design clinical trials.

Cross-species analysis of sequence and interaction data is often applied to determine the function of new genes. In contrast to these static measurements, microarrays measure the dynamic, condition-specific response of complex biological systems. The recent exponential growth in microarray expression datasets allows researchers to combine expression experiments from multiple species to identify genes that are not only conserved in sequence but also operated in a similar way in the different species studied. RESULTS: In this review we discuss the computational and technical challenges associated with these studies, the approaches that have been developed to address these challenges and the advantages of cross-species analysis of microarray data. We show how successful application of these methods lead to insights that cannot be obtained when analyzing data from a single species. We also highlight current open problems and discuss possible ways to address them.},

A large number of procedures for normalization and detection of differentially expressed genes have been proposed. However, the relative impact of these methods on the detection of differentially expressed genes remains to be determined. RESULTS: We have employed four different normalization methods and all possible combinations with three different statistical algorithms for detection of differentially expressed genes on a prototype dataset. The number of genes detected as differentially expressed differs by a factor of about three. Analysis of lists of genes detected as differentially expressed, and rank correlation coefficients for probability of differential expression shows that a high concordance between different methods can only be achieved by using the same normalization procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization has a profound influence of detection of differentially expressed genes. This influence is higher than that of three subsequent statistical analysis procedures examined. Algorithms incorporating more array-derived information than gene-expression values alone are urgently needed.},

We identified 4,195 candidate disease associated genes for 1028 diseases. On average, about 50\% of disease associated genes of a disease are statistically mapped to pathways. We generated a disease network which consists of 591 diseases and 6,931 disease relationships. We examined properties of this network and provided examples of novel disease relationships which cannot be readily captured through simple literature search or gene overlap analysis.

The application of semantic similarity to biomedical ontologies is recent; nevertheless, several studies have been published in the last few years describing and evaluating diverse approaches. Semantic similarity has become a valuable tool for validating the results drawn from biomedical studies such as gene clustering, gene expression data analysis, prediction and validation of molecular interactions, and disease gene prioritization. We review semantic similarity measures applied to biomedical ontologies and propose their classification according to the strategies they employ: node-based versus edge-based and pairwise versus groupwise. We also present comparative assessment studies and discuss the implications of their results. We survey the existing implementations of semantic similarity measures, and we describe examples of applications to biomedical research. This will clarify how biomedical researchers can benefit from semantic similarity measures and help them choose the approach most suitable for their studies.Biomedical ontologies are evolving toward increased coverage, formality, and integration, and their use for annotation is increasingly becoming a focus of both effort by biomedical experts and application of automated annotation procedures to create corpora of higher quality and completeness than are currently available. Given that semantic similarity measures are directly dependent on these evolutions, we can expect to see them gaining more relevance and even becoming as essential as sequence similarity is today in biomedical research.},

abstract = {Computational biology is essential in the process of translating biological knowledge into clinical practice, as well as in the understanding of biological phenomena based on the resources and technologies originating from the clinical environment. One such key contribution of computational biology is the discovery of biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes using 'omic' information. This process involves the predictive modelling and integration of different types of data and knowledge for screening, diagnostic or prognostic purposes. Moreover, this requires the design and combination of different methodologies based on statistical analysis and machine learning. This article introduces key computational approaches and applications to biomarker discovery based on different types of 'omic' data. Although we emphasize applications in cardiovascular research, the computational requirements and advances discussed here are also relevant to other domains. We will start by introducing some of the contributions of computational biology to translational research, followed by an overview of methods and technologies used for the identification of biomarkers with predictive or classification value. The main types of 'omic' approaches to biomarker discovery will be presented with specific examples from cardiovascular research. This will include a review of computational methodologies for single-source and integrative data applications. Major computational methods for model evaluation will be described together with recommendations for reporting models and results. We will present recent advances in cardiovascular biomarker discovery based on the combination of gene expression and functional network analyses. The review will conclude with a discussion of key challenges for computational biology, including perspectives from the biosciences and clinical areas.},

abstract = {Microarray gene expression data becomes more valuable as our confidence in the results grows. Guaranteeing data quality becomes increasingly important as microarrays are being used to diagnose and treat patients (1-4). The MAQC Quality Control Consortium, the FDA's Critical Path Initiative, NCI's caBIG and others are implementing procedures that will broadly enhance data quality. As GEO continues to grow, its usefulness is constrained by the level of correlation across experiments and general applicability. Although RNA preparation and array platform play important roles in data accuracy, pre-processing is a user-selected factor that has an enormous effect. Normalization of expression data is necessary, but the methods have specific and pronounced effects on precision, accuracy and historical correlation. As a case study, we present a microarray calibration process using normalization as the adjustable parameter. We examine the impact of eight normalizations across both Agilent and Affymetrix expression platforms on three expression readouts: (1) sensitivity and power, (2) functional/biological interpretation and (3) feature selection and classification error. The reader is encouraged to measure their own discordant data, whether cross-laboratory, cross-platform or across any other variance source, and to use their results to tune the adjustable parameters of their laboratory to ensure increased correlation.},

abstract = {Intestinal crypts in mammals are comprised of long-lived stem cells and shorter-lived progenies. These two populations are maintained in specific proportions during adult life. Here, we investigate the design principles governing the dynamics of these proportions during crypt morphogenesis. Using optimal control theory, we show that a proliferation strategy known as a "bang-bang" control minimizes the time to obtain a mature crypt. This strategy consists of a surge of symmetric stem cell divisions, establishing the entire stem cell pool first, followed by a sharp transition to strictly asymmetric stem cell divisions, producing nonstem cells with a delay. We validate these predictions using lineage tracing and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization of intestinal crypts in infant mice, uncovering small crypts that are entirely composed of Lgr5-labeled stem cells, which become a minority as crypts continue to grow. Our approach can be used to uncover similar design principles in other developmental systems.},

However, it remains unclear how these elements combine to control cellular behavior. We analyzed the probabilistic and transient differentiation of Bacillus subtilis cells into the state of competence. A few key parameters independently tuned the frequency of initiation and the duration of competence episodes and allowed the circuit to access different dynamic regimes, including oscillation. Altering circuit architecture showed that the duration of competence events can be made more precise. We used an experimental method to reduce global cellular noise and showed that noise levels are correlated with frequency of differentiation events. Together, the data reveal a noise-dependent circuit that is remarkably resilient and tunable in terms of its dynamic behavior.},

abstract = {Cells are intrinsically noisy biochemical reactors: low reactant numbers can lead to significant statistical fluctuations in molecule numbers and reaction rates. Here we use an analytic model to investigate the emergent noise properties of genetic systems. We find for a single gene that noise is essentially determined at the translational level, and that the mean and variance of protein concentration can be independently controlled. The noise strength immediately following single gene induction is almost twice the final steady-state value. We find that fluctuations in the concentrations of a regulatory protein can propagate through a genetic cascade; translational noise control could explain the inefficient translation rates observed for genes encoding such regulatory proteins. For an autoregulatory protein, we demonstrate that negative feedback efficiently decreases system noise. The model can be used to predict the noise characteristics of networks of arbitrary connectivity. The general procedure is further illustrated for an autocatalytic protein and a bistable genetic switch. The analysis of intrinsic noise reveals biological roles of gene network structures and can lead to a deeper understanding of their evolutionary origin.},

abstract = {Ultrasensitive responses are crucial for cellular regulation. Protein sequestration, where an active protein is bound in an inactive complex by an inhibitor, can potentially generate ultrasensitivity. Here, in a synthetic genetic circuit in budding yeast, we show that sequestration of a basic leucine zipper transcription factor by a dominant-negative inhibitor converts a graded transcriptional response into a sharply ultrasensitive response, with apparent Hill coefficients up to 12. A simple quantitative model for this genetic network shows that both the threshold and the degree of ultrasensitivity depend upon the abundance of the inhibitor, exactly as we observed experimentally. The abundance of the inhibitor can be altered by simple mutation; thus, ultrasensitive responses mediated by protein sequestration are easily tuneable. Gene duplication of regulatory homodimers and loss-of-function mutations can create dominant negatives that sequester and inactivate the original regulator. The generation of flexible ultrasensitive responses is an unappreciated adaptive advantage that could explain the frequent evolutionary emergence of dominant negatives.},

abstract = {Stochasticity is a hallmark of cellular processes, and different classes of genes show large differences in their cell-to-cell variability (noise). To decipher the sources and consequences of this noise, we systematically measured pairwise correlations between large numbers of genes, including those with high variability. We find that there is substantial pathway variability shared across similarly regulated genes. This induces quantitative correlations in the expression of functionally related genes such as those involved in the Msn2/4 stress response pathway, amino-acid biosynthesis, and mitochondrial maintenance. Bioinformatic analyses and genetic perturbations suggest that fluctuations in PKA and Tor signaling contribute to pathway-specific variability. Our results argue that a limited number of well-delineated "noise regulons" operate across a yeast cell and that such coordinated fluctuations enable a stochastic but coherent induction of functionally related genes. Finally, we show that pathway noise is a quantitative tool for exploring pathway features and regulatory relationships in un-stimulated systems.},

Here we show, using time-lapse microscopy, that Crz1 exhibits short bursts of nuclear localization (typically lasting 2 min) that occur stochastically in individual cells and propagate to the expression of downstream genes. Strikingly, calcium concentration controls the frequency, but not the duration, of localization bursts. Using an analytic model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this theory with natural and synthetic Crz1 target promoters. Another stress-response transcription factor, Msn2, exhibits similar, but largely uncorrelated, localization bursts under calcium stress suggesting that frequency-modulation regulation of localization bursts may be a general control strategy used by the cell to coordinate multi-gene responses to external signals.},

In an attempt to increase the effective concentration of each component of a pathway of interest, we built synthetic protein scaffolds that spatially recruit metabolic enzymes in a designable manner. Scaffolds bearing interaction domains from metazoan signaling proteins specifically accrue pathway enzymes tagged with their cognate peptide ligands. The natural modularity of these domains enabled us to optimize the stoichiometry of three mevalonate biosynthetic enzymes recruited to a synthetic complex and thereby achieve 77-fold improvement in product titer with low enzyme expression and reduced metabolic load. One of the same scaffolds was used to triple the yield of glucaric acid, despite high titers (0.5 g/l) without the synthetic complex. These strategies should prove generalizeable to other metabolic pathways and programmable for fine-tuning pathway flux.},

Based on data from the literature, we argue that the substrate uptake rate is the core variable in the system that controls the global metabolic phenotype. Consequently the metabolic phenotype that the cell expresses is not dependent on the type of the sugar or its concentration, but only on the rate at which the sugar enters the cell. As this requires the cells to 'measure' metabolic flux, we discuss the existing hints towards flux-sensing mechanism in this organism and also outline several aspects of the respectively involved flux-dependent regulation system. It becomes clear that the sensing and regulation system that divides the taken up carbon flux into the respiratory or fermentative pathways is complex with many molecular components interacting on multiple levels. To obtain a true understanding about how the global metabolic phenotype of S. cerevisiae is controlled by the glucose uptake rate, different tools and approaches from systems biology will be required.},

These properties, which include multistability and oscillations, have been found in specialized gene circuits such as the bacteriophage lambda switch and the Cyanobacteria circadian oscillator. However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch-a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network-in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.},

abstract = {Biodiversity, or the relative abundance of species, measures the persistence of an ecosystem. To better understand its modulation, we analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of a synthetic, chemical-mediated ecosystem that consisted of two engineered Escherichia coli populations. Depending on the specific experimental conditions implemented, the dominant interaction between the two populations could be competition for nutrients or predation due to engineered communication. While the two types of interactions resulted in different spatial patterns, they demonstrated a common trend in terms of the modulation of biodiversity. Specifically, biodiversity decreased with increasing cellular motility if the segregation distance between the two populations was comparable to the length scale of the chemical-mediated interaction. Otherwise, biodiversity was insensitive to cellular motility. Our results suggested a simple criterion for predicting the modulation of biodiversity by habitat partitioning and cellular motility in chemical-mediated ecosystems.},

A fundamental question is whether advantageous mutations lead to selection of clonal genomes or, as in sexual eukaryotes, sweep through populations on their own. Here, we show that in two recently diverged populations of ocean bacteria, ecological differentiation has occurred akin to a sexual mechanism: A few genome regions have swept through subpopulations in a habitat-specific manner, accompanied by gradual separation of gene pools as evidenced by increased habitat specificity of the most recent recombinations. These findings reconcile previous, seemingly contradictory empirical observations of the genetic structure of bacterial populations and point to a more unified process of differentiation in bacteria and sexual eukaryotes than previously thought.},

abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or "noisy," process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates "intrinsic" noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent "extrinsic" noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than approximately 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable-a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

abstract = {Proper functioning of biological cells requires that the process of protein expression be carried out with high efficiency and fidelity. Given an amino-acid sequence of a protein, multiple degrees of freedom still remain that may allow evolution to tune efficiency and fidelity for each gene under various conditions and cell types. Particularly, the redundancy of the genetic code allows the choice between alternative codons for the same amino acid, which, although 'synonymous,' may exert dramatic effects on the process of translation. Here we review modern developments in genomics and systems biology that have revolutionized our understanding of the multiple means by which translation is regulated. We suggest new means to model the process of translation in a richer framework that will incorporate information about gene sequences, the tRNA pool of the organism and the thermodynamic stability of the mRNA transcripts. A practical demonstration of a better understanding of the process would be a more accurate prediction of the proteome, given the transcriptome at a diversity of biological conditions.},

Here we show that this relation, which we call the gene regulation function (GRF), fluctuates dynamically in individual living cells, thereby limiting the accuracy with which transcriptional genetic circuits can transfer signals. Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter P(R) in Escherichia coli. A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones.},

abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-lambda, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks and in the decrease of precision of cell signals. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

It typically involves cell-cell communication and intracellular signal processing. Here we show a synthetic multicellular system in which genetically engineered 'receiver' cells are programmed to form ring-like patterns of differentiation based on chemical gradients of an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal that is synthesized by 'sender' cells. In receiver cells, 'band-detect' gene networks respond to user-defined ranges of AHL concentrations. By fusing different fluorescent proteins as outputs of network variants, an initially undifferentiated 'lawn' of receivers is engineered to form a bullseye pattern around a sender colony. Other patterns, such as ellipses and clovers, are achieved by placing senders in different configurations. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal which kinetic parameters most significantly affect ring development over time. Construction and study of such synthetic multicellular systems can improve our quantitative understanding of naturally occurring developmental processes and may foster applications in tissue engineering, biomaterial fabrication and biosensing.},

In this work, we address this problem by integrating a large number of experimental data sets with a model of the metabolism of Escherichia coli. Using a combination of computational tools including the concept of elementary flux patterns, methods from network inference and dynamic optimization, we find that transcriptional regulation of pathways reflects the protein investment into these pathways. While pathways that are associated to a high protein cost are controlled by fine-tuned transcriptional programs, pathways that only require a small protein cost are transcriptionally controlled in a few key reactions. As a reason for the occurrence of these different regulatory strategies, we identify an evolutionary trade-off between the conflicting requirements to reduce protein investment and the requirement to be able to respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The phenotypic differences between individual organisms can often be ascribed to underlying genetic and environmental variation. However, even genetically identical organisms in homogeneous environments vary, indicating that randomness in developmental processes such as gene expression may also generate diversity. To examine the consequences of gene expression variability in multicellular organisms, we studied intestinal specification in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which wild-type cell fate is invariant and controlled by a small transcriptional network. Mutations in elements of this network can have indeterminate effects: some mutant embryos fail to develop intestinal cells, whereas others produce intestinal precursors. By counting transcripts of the genes in this network in individual embryos, we show that the expression of an otherwise redundant gene becomes highly variable in the mutants and that this variation is subjected to a threshold, producing an ON/OFF expression pattern of the master regulatory gene of intestinal differentiation. Our results demonstrate that mutations in developmental networks can expose otherwise buffered stochastic variability in gene expression, leading to pronounced phenotypic variation.},

Our large-scale information-theoretical analysis of > 950 TF-binding motifs demonstrates that prokaryotes and eukaryotes use strikingly different strategies to target TFs to specific genome locations. Although bacterial TFs can recognize a specific DNA site in the genomic background, eukaryotic TFs exhibit widespread, nonfunctional binding and require clustering of sites to achieve specificity. We find support for this mechanism in a range of experimental studies and in our evolutionary analysis of DNA-binding domains.

abstract = {A fundamental problem in biology is understanding the evolutionary emergence and maintenance of altruistic behaviors. A well-recognized conceptual insight is provided by a general mathematical relation, Hamilton's rule. This rule can in principle be invoked to explain natural examples of cooperation, but measuring the variables that it involves is a particularly challenging problem and controlling these variables experimentally an even more daunting task. Here, we overcome these difficulties by using a simple synthetic microbial system of producers and nonproducers of an extracellular growth-enhancing molecule, which acts as a 'common good.' For this system, we are able to manipulate the intrinsic growth difference between producers and nonproducers, as well as the impact of the common good on the growth rate of its recipients. Our synthetic system is thus uniquely suited for studying the relation between the parameters entering Hamilton's rule and the quantities governing the systems' behavior. The experimental results highlight a crucial effect of nonlinearities in the response to the common good, which in general tend to limit the predictive value of Hamilton's rule.},

abstract = {Biofilm formation is an example of a multicellular process which depends on cooperative behavior and differentiation within a bacterial population. Our findings indicate that there is a complex feedback loop that maintains the stoichiometry of the extracellular matrix and other proteins required for complex colony development by Bacillus subtilis. Analysis of the transcriptional regulation of two DegU-activated genes that are required for complex colony development by B. subtilis revealed additional involvement of global regulators that are central to controlling biofilm formation. Activation of transcription from both the yvcA and yuaB promoters requires DegU approximately phosphate, but transcription is inhibited by direct AbrB binding to the promoter regions. Inhibition of transcription by AbrB is relieved when Spo0A approximately phosphate is generated due to its known role in inhibiting abrB expression. Deletion of SinR, a key coordinator of motility and biofilm formation, enhanced transcription from both loci; however, no evidence of a direct interaction with SinR for either the yvcA or yuaB promoter regions was observed. The enhanced transcription in the sinR mutant background was subsequently demonstrated to be dependent on biosynthesis of the polysaccharide component that forms the major constituent of the B. subtilis biofilm matrix. Together, these findings indicate that a genetic network dependent on activation of both DegU and Spo0A controls complex colony development by B. subtilis.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, experimental data on the fluctuations in gene activity between individual cells and within the same cell over time have confirmed that gene expression is a "noisy" process. This variation is in part due to the small number of molecules taking part in some of the key reactions that are involved in gene expression. One of the consequences of this is that protein production often occurs in bursts, each due to a single promoter or transcription factor binding event. Recently, the distribution of the number of proteins produced in such bursts has been experimentally measured, offering a unique opportunity to study the relative importance of different sources of noise in gene expression. Here, we provide a derivation of the theoretical probability distribution of these bursts for a wide variety of different models of gene expression. We show that there is a good fit between our theoretical distribution and that obtained from two different published experimental datasets. We then prove that, irrespective of the details of the model, the burst size distribution is always geometric and hence determined by a single parameter. Many different combinations of the biochemical rates for the constituent reactions of both transcription and translation will therefore lead to the same experimentally observed burst size distribution. It is thus impossible to identify different sources of fluctuations purely from protein burst size data or to use such data to estimate all of the model parameters. We explore methods of inferring these values when additional types of experimental data are available.},

abstract = {In response to environmental changes, the connections ("arrows") in gene regulatory networks determine which genes modulate their expression, but the quantitative parameters of the network ("the numbers on the arrows") are equally important in determining the resulting phenotype. What are the objectives and constraints by which evolution determines these parameters? We explore these issues by analyzing gene expression changes in a number of yeast metabolic pathways in response to nutrient depletion. We find that a striking pattern emerges that couples the regulatory architecture of the pathway to the gene expression response. In particular, we find that pathways controlled by the intermediate metabolite activation (IMA) architecture, in which an intermediate metabolite activates transcription of pathway genes, exhibit the following response: the enzyme immediately downstream of the regulatory metabolite is under the strongest transcriptional control, whereas the induction of the enzymes upstream of the regulatory intermediate is relatively weak. This pattern of responses is absent in pathways not controlled by an IMA architecture. The observation can be explained by the constraint imposed by the fundamental feedback structure of the network, which places downstream enzymes under a negative feedback loop and upstream ones under a positive feedback loop. This general design principle for transcriptional control of a metabolic pathway can be derived from a simple cost/benefit model of gene expression, in which the observed pattern is an optimal solution. Our results suggest that the parameters regulating metabolic enzyme expression are optimized by evolution, under the strong constraint of the underlying regulatory architecture.},

abstract = {Networks of interacting proteins orchestrate the responses of living cells to a variety of external stimuli, but how sensitive is the functioning of these protein networks to variations in their biochemical parameters? One possibility is that to achieve appropriate function, the reaction rate constants and enzyme concentrations need to be adjusted in a precise manner, and any deviation from these 'fine-tuned' values ruins the network's performance. An alternative possibility is that key properties of biochemical networks are robust; that is, they are insensitive to the precise values of the biochemical parameters. Here we address this issue in experiments using chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, one of the best-characterized sensory systems. We focus on how response and adaptation to attractant signals vary with systematic changes in the intracellular concentration of the components of the chemotaxis network. We find that some properties, such as steady-state behaviour and adaptation time, show strong variations in response to varying protein concentrations. In contrast, the precision of adaptation is robust and does not vary with the protein concentrations. This is consistent with a recently proposed molecular mechanism for exact adaptation, where robustness is a direct consequence of the network's architecture.},

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

abstract = {Understanding the behavior of basic biomolecular components as parts of larger systems is one of the goals of the developing field of synthetic biology. A multidisciplinary approach, involving mathematical and computational modeling in parallel with experimentation, is often crucial for gaining such insights and improving the efficiency of artificial gene network design. Here we used such an approach and developed a combinatorial promoter design strategy to characterize how the position and multiplicity of tetO(2) operator sites within the GAL1 promoter affect gene expression levels and gene expression noise in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We observed stronger transcriptional repression and higher gene expression noise as a single operator site was moved closer to the TATA box, whereas for multiple operator-containing promoters, we found that the position and number of operator sites together determined the dose-response curve and gene expression noise. We developed a generic computational model that captured the experimentally observed differences for each of the promoters, and more detailed models to successively predict the behavior of multiple operator-containing promoters from single operator-containing promoters. Our results suggest that the independent binding of single repressors is not sufficient to explain the more complex behavior of the multiple operator-containing promoters. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of joint experimental-computational efforts and some of the challenges of using a bottom-up approach based on well characterized, isolated biomolecular components for predicting the behavior of complex, synthetic gene networks, e.g., the whole can be different from the sum of its parts.},

abstract = {Multistability, the capacity to achieve multiple internal states in response to a single set of external inputs, is the defining characteristic of a switch. Biological switches are essential for the determination of cell fate in multicellular organisms, the regulation of cell-cycle oscillations during mitosis and the maintenance of epigenetic traits in microbes. The multistability of several natural and synthetic systems has been attributed to positive feedback loops in their regulatory networks. However, feedback alone does not guarantee multistability. The phase diagram of a multistable system, a concise description of internal states as key parameters are varied, reveals the conditions required to produce a functional switch. Here we present the phase diagram of the bistable lactose utilization network of Escherichia coli. We use this phase diagram, coupled with a mathematical model of the network, to quantitatively investigate processes such as sugar uptake and transcriptional regulation in vivo. We then show how the hysteretic response of the wild-type system can be converted to an ultrasensitive graded response. The phase diagram thus serves as a sensitive probe of molecular interactions and as a powerful tool for rational network design.},

Ironically, despite having one of the highest ratios of graphical to textual information, biology still lacks standard graphical notations. The recent deluge of biological knowledge makes addressing this deficit a pressing concern. Toward this goal, we present the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN), a visual language developed by a community of biochemists, modelers and computer scientists. SBGN consists of three complementary languages: process diagram, entity relationship diagram and activity flow diagram. Together they enable scientists to represent networks of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way. We believe that SBGN will foster efficient and accurate representation, visualization, storage, exchange and reuse of information on all kinds of biological knowledge, from gene regulation, to metabolism, to cellular signaling.},

Maximal independent set (MIS) selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a network. A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly’s nervous system, when sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are chosen. By studying SOP selection, we derived a fast algorithm for MIS selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages. Our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights.},

abstract = {De novo engineering of gene circuits inside cells is extremely difficult, and efforts to realize predictable and robust performance must deal with noise in gene expression and variation in phenotypes between cells. Here we demonstrate that by coupling gene expression to cell survival and death using cell-cell communication, we can programme the dynamics of a population despite variability in the behaviour of individual cells. Specifically, we have built and characterized a 'population control' circuit that autonomously regulates the density of an Escherichia coli population. The cell density is broadcasted and detected by elements from a bacterial quorum-sensing system, which in turn regulate the death rate. As predicted by a simple mathematical model, the circuit can set a stable steady state in terms of cell density and gene expression that is easily tunable by varying the stability of the cell-cell communication signal. This circuit incorporates a mechanism for programmed death in response to changes in the environment, and allows us to probe the design principles of its more complex natural counterparts.},

abstract = {The strength of selection in populations has traditionally been inferred by measuring changes in bulk population parameters, such as mean reproductive rates. Untangling the effect of selection from other factors, such as specific responses to environmental fluctuations, poses a significant problem both in microbiology and in other fields, including cancer biology and immunology, where selection occurs within phenotypically heterogeneous populations of cells. Using "individual histories"--temporal sequences of all reproduction events and phenotypic changes of individuals and their ancestors--we present an alternative approach to quantifying selection in diverse experimental settings. Selection is viewed as a process that acts on histories, and a measure of selection that employs the distribution of histories is introduced. We apply this measure to phenotypically structured populations in fluctuating environments across different evolutionary regimes. Additionally, we show that reproduction events alone, recorded in the population's tree of cell divisions, may be sufficient to accurately measure selection. The measure is thus applicable in a wide range of biological systems, from microorganisms--including species for which genetic tools do not yet exist--to cellular populations, such as tumors and stem cells, where detailed temporal data are becoming available.},

abstract = {Modelers of molecular signaling networks must cope with the combinatorial explosion of protein states generated by posttranslational modifications and complex formation. Rule-based models provide a powerful alternative to approaches that require explicit enumeration of all possible molecular species of a system. Such models consist of formal rules stipulating the (partial) contexts wherein specific protein-protein interactions occur. These contexts specify molecular patterns that are usually less detailed than molecular species. Yet, the execution of rule-based dynamics requires stochastic simulation, which can be very costly. It thus appears desirable to convert a rule-based model into a reduced system of differential equations by exploiting the granularity at which rules specify interactions. We present a formal (and automated) method for constructing a coarse-grained and self-consistent dynamical system aimed at molecular patterns that are distinguishable by the dynamics of the original system as posited by the rules. The method is formally sound and never requires the execution of the rule-based model. The coarse-grained variables do not depend on the values of the rate constants appearing in the rules, and typically form a system of greatly reduced dimension that can be amenable to numerical integration and further model reduction techniques.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory circuits can use dynamic, and even stochastic, strategies to respond to environmental conditions. We examined activation of the general stress response mediated by the alternative sigma factor, $\sigma$(B), in individual Bacillus subtilis cells. We observed that energy stress activates $\sigma$(B) in discrete stochastic pulses, with increasing levels of stress leading to higher pulse frequencies. By perturbing and rewiring the endogenous system, we found that this behavior results from three key features of the $\sigma$(B) circuit: an ultrasensitive phosphorylation switch; stochasticity ("noise"), which activates that switch; and a mixed (positive and negative) transcriptional feedback, which can both amplify a pulse and switch it off. Together, these results show how prokaryotes encode signals using stochastic pulse frequency modulation through a compact regulatory architecture.},

Specifically, it is unknown whether miRNA-containing networks have recurrent circuit motifs, as has been observed in regulatory networks of bacteria and yeast. Here we develop a computational method that utilizes gene expression data to show that two classes of circuits-corresponding to positive and negative transcriptional coregulation of a miRNA and its targets-are prevalent in the human and mouse genomes. Additionally, we find that neuronal-enriched miRNAs tend to be coexpressed with their target genes, suggesting that these miRNAs could be involved in neuronal homeostasis. Our results strongly suggest that coordinated transcriptional and miRNA-mediated regulation is a recurrent motif to enhance the robustness of gene regulation in mammalian genomes.},

Analyzing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling revealed that individual TNF signaling pathways transduce information sufficient for accurate binary decisions, and an upstream bottleneck limits the information gained via multiple integrated pathways. Negative feedback to this bottleneck could both alleviate and enhance its limiting effect, despite decreasing noise. Bottlenecks likewise constrain information attained by networks signaling through multiple genes or cells.},

For type 1 diabetes it is clear that multiple islet molecules are the target of autoimmunity in man and animal models. It is not clear whether any of the target molecules are essential for the destruction of islet beta cells. Here we show that the proinsulin/insulin molecules have a sequence that is a primary target of the autoimmunity that causes diabetes of the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. We created insulin 1 and insulin 2 gene knockouts combined with a mutated proinsulin transgene (in which residue 16 on the B chain was changed to alanine) in NOD mice. This mutation abrogated the T-cell stimulation of a series of the major insulin autoreactive NOD T-cell clones. Female mice with only the altered insulin did not develop insulin autoantibodies, insulitis or autoimmune diabetes, in contrast with mice containing at least one copy of the native insulin gene. We suggest that proinsulin is a primary autoantigen of the NOD mouse, and speculate that organ-restricted autoimmune disorders with marked major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction of disease are likely to have specific primary autoantigens.},

abstract = {The KZN strain family of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a highly virulent strain endemic to the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa, which has recently experienced an outbreak of extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis. To investigate the causes and evolution of drug-resistance, we determined the DNA sequences of several clinical isolates--one drug-susceptible, one multi-drug resistant, and nine extensively drug-resistant--using whole-genome sequencing. Analysis of polymorphisms among the strains is consistent with the drug-susceptibility profiles, in that well-known mutations are observed that are correlated with resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, kanamycin, ofloxacin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. However, the mutations responsible for rifampicin resistance in rpoB and pyrazinamide in pncA are in different nucleotide positions in the multi-drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains, clearly showing that they acquired these mutations independently, and that the XDR strain could not have evolved directly from the MDR strain (though it could have arisen from another similar MDR strain). Sequencing of eight additional XDR strains from other areas of KwaZulu-Natal shows that they have identical drug resistant mutations to the first one sequenced, including the same polymorphisms at sites associated with drug resistance, supporting the theory that this represents a case of clonal expansion.},

abstract = {Networks of interacting proteins orchestrate the responses of living cells to a variety of external stimuli, but how sensitive is the functioning of these protein networks to variations in their biochemical parameters? One possibility is that to achieve appropriate function, the reaction rate constants and enzyme concentrations need to be adjusted in a precise manner, and any deviation from these 'fine-tuned' values ruins the network's performance. An alternative possibility is that key properties of biochemical networks are robust; that is, they are insensitive to the precise values of the biochemical parameters. Here we address this issue in experiments using chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, one of the best-characterized sensory systems. We focus on how response and adaptation to attractant signals vary with systematic changes in the intracellular concentration of the components of the chemotaxis network. We find that some properties, such as steady-state behaviour and adaptation time, show strong variations in response to varying protein concentrations. In contrast, the precision of adaptation is robust and does not vary with the protein concentrations. This is consistent with a recently proposed molecular mechanism for exact adaptation, where robustness is a direct consequence of the network's architecture.},

This focus was elegantly set in motion a decade ago with the design and construction of a genetic toggle switch and an oscillator, with subsequent highlights that have included circuits capable of pattern generation, noise shaping, edge detection and event counting. Here we describe an engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells. Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate. The synchronized genetic clock sets the stage for the use of microbes in the creation of a macroscopic biosensor with an oscillatory output. Furthermore, it provides a specific model system for the generation of a mechanistic description of emergent coordinated behaviour at the colony level.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory interactions are context dependent, active in some cellular states but not in others. Stochastic fluctuations, or 'noise', in gene expression propagate through active, but not inactive, regulatory links. Thus, correlations in gene expression noise could provide a noninvasive means to probe the activity states of regulatory links. However, global, 'extrinsic', noise sources generate correlations even without direct regulatory links. Here we show that single-cell time-lapse microscopy, by revealing time lags due to regulation, can discriminate between active regulatory connections and extrinsic noise. We demonstrate this principle mathematically, using stochastic modeling, and experimentally, using simple synthetic gene circuits. We then use this approach to analyze dynamic noise correlations in the galactose metabolism genes of Escherichia coli. We find that the CRPGalS-GalE feed-forward loop is inactive in standard conditions but can become active in a GalR mutant. These results show how noise can help analyze the context dependence of regulatory interactions in endogenous gene circuits.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory circuits with different architectures (patterns of regulatory interactions) can generate similar dynamics. This raises the question of why a particular circuit architecture is selected to implement a given cellular process. To investigate this problem, we compared the Bacillus subtilis circuit that regulates differentiation into the competence state to an engineered circuit with an alternative architecture (SynEx) in silico and in vivo. Time-lapse microscopy measurements showed that SynEx cells generated competence dynamics similar to native cells and reconstituted the physiology of differentiation. However, architectural differences between the circuits altered the dynamic distribution of stochastic fluctuations (noise) during circuit operation. This distinction in noise causes functional differences between the circuits by selectively controlling the timing of competence episodes and response of the system to various DNA concentrations. These results reveal a tradeoff between temporal precision and physiological response range that is controlled by distinct noise characteristics of alternative circuit architectures.},

abstract = {Genetic control of enzyme activity drives metabolic adaptations to environmental changes, and therefore the feedback interaction between gene expression and metabolism is essential to cell fitness. In this paper we develop a new formalism to detect the equilibrium regimes of an unbranched metabolic network under transcriptional feedback from one metabolite. Our results indicate that one-to-all transcriptional feedback can induce a wide range of metabolic phenotypes, including mono-, multistability and oscillatory behavior. The analysis is based on the use of switch-like models for transcriptional control and the exploitation of the time scale separation between metabolic and genetic dynamics. For any combination of activation and repression feedback loops, we derive conditions for the emergence of a specific phenotype in terms of genetic parameters such as enzyme expression rates and regulatory thresholds. We find that metabolic oscillations can emerge under uniform thresholds and, in the case of operon-controlled networks, the analysis reveals how nutrient-induced bistability and oscillations can emerge as a consequence of the transcriptional feedback.},

abstract = {The Notch-Delta signalling pathway allows communication between neighbouring cells during development. It has a critical role in the formation of 'fine-grained' patterns, generating distinct cell fates among groups of initially equivalent neighbouring cells and sharply delineating neighbouring regions in developing tissues. The Delta ligand has been shown to have two activities: it transactivates Notch in neighbouring cells and cis-inhibits Notch in its own cell. However, it remains unclear how Notch integrates these two activities and how the resulting system facilitates pattern formation. Here we report the development of a quantitative time-lapse microscopy platform for analysing Notch-Delta signalling dynamics in individual mammalian cells, with the aim of addressing these issues. By controlling both cis- and trans-Delta concentrations, and monitoring the dynamics of a Notch reporter, we measured the combined cis-trans input-output relationship in the Notch-Delta system. The data revealed a striking difference between the responses of Notch to trans- and cis-Delta: whereas the response to trans-Delta is graded, the response to cis-Delta is sharp and occurs at a fixed threshold, independent of trans-Delta. We developed a simple mathematical model that shows how these behaviours emerge from the mutual inactivation of Notch and Delta proteins in the same cell. This interaction generates an ultrasensitive switch between mutually exclusive sending (high Delta/low Notch) and receiving (high Notch/low Delta) signalling states. At the multicellular level, this switch can amplify small differences between neighbouring cells even without transcription-mediated feedback. This Notch-Delta signalling switch facilitates the formation of sharp boundaries and lateral-inhibition patterns in models of development, and provides insight into previously unexplained mutant behaviours.},

Here we present an approach that couples libraries of diversified components (synthesized with randomized nonessential sequence) with in silico modeling to guide predictable gene network construction without the need for post hoc tweaking. We demonstrate our approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by synthesizing regulatory promoter libraries and using them to construct feed-forward loop networks with different predicted input-output characteristics. We then expand our method to produce a synthetic gene network acting as a predictable timer, modifiable by component choice. We use this network to control the timing of yeast sedimentation, illustrating how the plug-and-play nature of our design can be readily applied to biotechnology.},

Scaffolds bearing interaction domains from metazoan signaling proteins specifically accrue pathway enzymes tagged with their cognate peptide ligands. The natural modularity of these domains enabled us to optimize the stoichiometry of three mevalonate biosynthetic enzymes recruited to a synthetic complex and thereby achieve 77-fold improvement in product titer with low enzyme expression and reduced metabolic load. One of the same scaffolds was used to triple the yield of glucaric acid, despite high titers (0.5 g/l) without the synthetic complex. These strategies should prove generalizeable to other metabolic pathways and programmable for fine-tuning pathway flux.},

abstract = {We have synthesized a 582,970-base pair Mycoplasma genitalium genome. This synthetic genome, named M. genitalium JCVI-1.0, contains all the genes of wild-type M. genitalium G37 except MG408, which was disrupted by an antibiotic marker to block pathogenicity and to allow for selection. To identify the genome as synthetic, we inserted "watermarks" at intergenic sites known to tolerate transposon insertions. Overlapping "cassettes" of 5 to 7 kilobases (kb), assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, were joined by in vitro recombination to produce intermediate assemblies of approximately 24 kb, 72 kb ("1/8 genome"), and 144 kb ("1/4 genome"), which were all cloned as bacterial artificial chromosomes in Escherichia coli. Most of these intermediate clones were sequenced, and clones of all four 1/4 genomes with the correct sequence were identified. The complete synthetic genome was assembled by transformation-associated recombination cloning in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, then isolated and sequenced. A clone with the correct sequence was identified. The methods described here will be generally useful for constructing large DNA molecules from chemically synthesized pieces and also from combinations of natural and synthetic DNA segments.},

abstract = {The construction of artificial networks of transcriptional control elements in living cells represents a new frontier for biological engineering. However, biological circuit engineers will have to confront their inability to predict the precise behavior of even the most simple synthetic networks, a serious shortcoming and challenge for the design and construction of more sophisticated genetic circuitry in the future. We propose a combined rational and evolutionary design strategy for constructing genetic regulatory circuits, an approach that allows the engineer to fine-tune the biochemical parameters of the networks experimentally in vivo. By applying directed evolution to genes comprising a simple genetic circuit, we demonstrate that a nonfunctional circuit containing improperly matched components can evolve rapidly into a functional one. In the process, we generated a library of genetic devices with a range of behaviors that can be used to construct more complex circuits.},

By applying the toolbox of engineering disciplines to biology, a whole set of potential applications become possible ranging very widely across scientific and engineering disciplines. Some of the potential benefits of synthetic biology, such as the development of low-cost drugs or the production of chemicals and energy by engineered bacteria are enormous. There are, however, also potential and perceived risks due to deliberate or accidental damage. Also, ethical issues of synthetic biology just start being explored, with hardly any ethicists specifically focusing on the area of synthetic biology. This book will be the first of its kind focusing particularly on the safety, security and ethical concerns and other relevant societal aspects of this new emerging field. The foreseen impact of this book will be to stimulate a debate on these societal issues at an early stage. Past experiences, especially in the field of GM-crops and stem cells, have shown the importance of an early societal debate. The community and informed stakeholders recognize this need, but up to now discussions are fragmentary. This book will be the first comprehensive overview on relevant societal issues of synthetic biology, setting the scene for further important discussions within the scientific community and with civil society.},

abstract = {Metabolic engineering has achieved encouraging success in producing foreign metabolites in a variety of hosts. However, common strategies for engineering metabolic pathways focus on amplifying the desired enzymes and deregulating cellular controls. As a result, uncontrolled or deregulated metabolic pathways lead to metabolic imbalance and suboptimal productivity. Here we have demonstrated the second stage of metabolic engineering effort by designing and engineering a regulatory circuit to control gene expression in response to intracellular metabolic states. Specifically, we recruited and altered one of the global regulatory systems in Escherichia coli, the Ntr regulon, to control the engineered lycopene biosynthesis pathway. The artificially engineered regulon, stimulated by excess glycolytic flux through sensing of an intracellular metabolite, acetyl phosphate, controls the expression of two key enzymes in lycopene synthesis in response to flux dynamics. This intracellular control loop significantly enhanced lycopene production while reducing the negative impact caused by metabolic imbalance. Although we demonstrated this strategy for metabolite production, it can be extended into other fields where gene expression must be closely controlled by intracellular physiology, such as gene therapy.},

In fields ranging from circadian biology to endocrinology, it remains an exciting challenge to understand how collective rhythms emerge in multicellular structures. Using mathematical and computational modeling, we study the effect of coupling through intercell signaling in a population of Escherichia coli cells expressing a synthetic biological clock. Our results predict that a diverse and noisy community of such genetic oscillators interacting through a quorum-sensing mechanism should self-synchronize in a robust way, leading to a substantially improved global rhythmicity in the system. As such, the particular system of coupled genetic oscillators considered here might be a good candidate to provide the first quantitative example of a synchronization transition in a population of biological oscillators.},

However, significant advancements in our ability to engineer biological systems have been limited by the foundational tools available for reporting on, responding to, and controlling intracellular components in living systems. Portable and scalable platforms are needed for the reliable construction of such communication and control systems across diverse organisms. We report an extensible RNA-based framework for engineering ligand-controlled gene-regulatory systems, called ribozyme switches, that exhibits tunable regulation, design modularity, and target specificity. These switch platforms contain a sensor domain, comprised of an aptamer sequence, and an actuator domain, comprised of a hammerhead ribozyme sequence. We examined two modes of standardized information transmission between these domains and demonstrate a mechanism that allows for the reliable and modular assembly of functioning synthetic RNA switches and regulation of ribozyme activity in response to various effectors. In addition to demonstrating examples of small molecule-responsive, in vivo functional, allosteric hammerhead ribozymes, this work describes a general approach for the construction of portable and scalable gene-regulatory systems. We demonstrate the versatility of the platform in implementing application-specific control systems for small molecule-mediated regulation of cell growth and noninvasive in vivo sensing of metabolite production.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Evolvability is an intrinsic feature of all living cells. However, newly emerging, evolved features can be undesirable when genetic circuits, designed and fabricated by rational, synthetic biological approaches, are installed in the cell. Streamlined-genome E. coli MDS42 is free of mutation-generating IS elements, and can serve as a host with reduced evolutionary potential. RESULTS: We analyze an extreme case of toxic plasmid clone instability, and show that random host IS element hopping, causing inactivation of the toxic cloned sequences, followed by automatic selection of the fast-growing mutants, can prevent the maintenance of a clone developed for vaccine production. Analyzing the molecular details, we identify a hydrophobic protein as the toxic byproduct of the clone, and show that IS elements spontaneously landing in the cloned fragment relieve the cell from the stress by blocking transcription of the toxic gene. Bioinformatics analysis of sequence reads from early shotgun genome sequencing projects, where clone libraries were constructed and maintained in E. coli, suggests that such IS-mediated inactivation of ectopic genes inhibiting the growth of the E. coli cloning host might happen more frequently than generally anticipated, leading to genomic instability and selection of altered clones. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed genetic adaptation of clean-genome, IS-free MDS42 host improves maintenance of unstable genetic constructs, and is suggested to be beneficial in both laboratory and industrial settings.},

A synthetic network exhibiting oscillatory behavior has recently been constructed [Elowitz, M. B. \& Leibler, S. (2000) Nature (London) 403, 335-338]. It has also been shown that a natural bacterial quorum-sensing mechanism can be used in a synthetic system to communicate a signal between two populations of cells, such that receipt of the signal causes expression of a target gene [Weiss, R. \& Knight, T. F. (2000) in DNA6: Sixth International Meeting on DNA-Based Computers, June 13-17, 2000, Leiden, The Netherlands]. We propose a synthetic gene network in Escherichia coli which combines these two features: the system acts as a relaxation oscillator and uses an intercell signaling mechanism to couple the oscillators and induce synchronous oscillations. We model the system and show that the proposed coupling scheme does lead to synchronous behavior across a population of cells. We provide an analytical treatment of the synchronization process, the dominant mechanism of which is "fast threshold modulation."},

abstract = {Engineered biological systems hold promise in addressing pressing human needs in chemical processing, energy production, materials construction, and maintenance and enhancement of human health and the environment. However, significant advancements in our ability to engineer biological systems have been limited by the foundational tools available for reporting on, responding to, and controlling intracellular components in living systems. Portable and scalable platforms are needed for the reliable construction of such communication and control systems across diverse organisms. We report an extensible RNA-based framework for engineering ligand-controlled gene-regulatory systems, called ribozyme switches, that exhibits tunable regulation, design modularity, and target specificity. These switch platforms contain a sensor domain, comprised of an aptamer sequence, and an actuator domain, comprised of a hammerhead ribozyme sequence. We examined two modes of standardized information transmission between these domains and demonstrate a mechanism that allows for the reliable and modular assembly of functioning synthetic RNA switches and regulation of ribozyme activity in response to various effectors. In addition to demonstrating examples of small molecule-responsive, in vivo functional, allosteric hammerhead ribozymes, this work describes a general approach for the construction of portable and scalable gene-regulatory systems. We demonstrate the versatility of the platform in implementing application-specific control systems for small molecule-mediated regulation of cell growth and noninvasive in vivo sensing of metabolite production.},

abstract = {The precise nature of information flow through a biological network, which is governed by factors such as response sensitivities and noise propagation, greatly affects the operation of biological systems. Quantitative analysis of these properties is often difficult in naturally occurring systems but can be greatly facilitated by studying simple synthetic networks. Here, we report the construction of synthetic transcriptional cascades comprising one, two, and three repression stages. These model systems enable us to analyze sensitivity and noise propagation as a function of network complexity. We demonstrate experimentally steady-state switching behavior that becomes sharper with longer cascades. The regulatory mechanisms that confer this ultrasensitive response both attenuate and amplify phenotypical variations depending on the system's input conditions. Although noise attenuation allows the cascade to act as a low-pass filter by rejecting short-lived perturbations in input conditions, noise amplification results in loss of synchrony among a cell population. The experimental results demonstrating the above network properties correlate well with simulations of a simple mathematical model of the system.},

abstract = {The formation of complexes between proteins and ligands is fundamental to biological processes at the molecular level. Manipulation of molecular recognition between ligands and proteins is therefore important for basic biological studies and has many biotechnological applications, including the construction of enzymes, biosensors, genetic circuits, signal transduction pathways and chiral separations. The systematic manipulation of binding sites remains a major challenge. Computational design offers enormous generality for engineering protein structure and function. Here we present a structure-based computational method that can drastically redesign protein ligand-binding specificities. This method was used to construct soluble receptors that bind trinitrotoluene, l-lactate or serotonin with high selectivity and affinity. These engineered receptors can function as biosensors for their new ligands; we also incorporated them into synthetic bacterial signal transduction pathways, regulating gene expression in response to extracellular trinitrotoluene or l-lactate. The use of various ligands and proteins shows that a high degree of control over biomolecular recognition has been established computationally. The biological and biosensing activities of the designed receptors illustrate potential applications of computational design.},

Although operons facilitate coordinated expression of multiple genes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, coordinating the many post-transcriptional processes that determine the relative levels of gene expression in operons by a priori design remains a challenge. We describe a method for tuning the expression of multiple genes within operons by generating libraries of tunable intergenic regions (TIGRs), recombining various post-transcriptional control elements and screening for the desired relative expression levels. TIGRs can vary the relative expression of two reporter genes over a 100-fold range and balance expression of three genes in an operon that encodes a heterologous mevalonate biosynthetic pathway, resulting in a sevenfold increase in mevalonate production. This technology should be useful for optimizing the expression of multiple genes in synthetic operons, both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.},

In an attempt to increase the effective concentration of each component of a pathway of interest, we built synthetic protein scaffolds that spatially recruit metabolic enzymes in a designable manner. Scaffolds bearing interaction domains from metazoan signaling proteins specifically accrue pathway enzymes tagged with their cognate peptide ligands. The natural modularity of these domains enabled us to optimize the stoichiometry of three mevalonate biosynthetic enzymes recruited to a synthetic complex and thereby achieve 77-fold improvement in product titer with low enzyme expression and reduced metabolic load. One of the same scaffolds was used to triple the yield of glucaric acid, despite high titers (0.5 g/l) without the synthetic complex. These strategies should prove generalizeable to other metabolic pathways and programmable for fine-tuning pathway flux.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In synthetic biology, gene regulatory circuits are often constructed by combining smaller circuit components. Connections between components are achieved by transcription factors acting on promoters. If the individual components behave as true modules and certain module interface conditions are satisfied, the function of the composite circuits can in principle be predicted. RESULTS: In this paper, we investigate one of the interface conditions: fan-out. We quantify the fan-out, a concept widely used in electrical engineering, to indicate the maximum number of the downstream inputs that an upstream output transcription factor can regulate. The fan-out is shown to be closely related to retroactivity studied by Del Vecchio, et al. An efficient operational method for measuring the fan-out is proposed and shown to be applied to various types of module interfaces. The fan-out is also shown to be enhanced by self-inhibitory regulation on the output. The potential role of an inhibitory regulation is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed estimation method for fan-out not only provides an experimentally efficient way for quantifying the level of modularity in gene regulatory circuits but also helps characterize and design module interfaces, enabling the modular construction of gene circuits.},

An enzyme tuning strategy was implemented that identified activity differences between variants from different plants and determined optimal expression levels. By synthesizing both stereoisomer forms of reticuline and integrating enzyme activities from three plant sources and humans, we demonstrated the synthesis of metabolites in the sanguinarine/berberine and morphinan branches. We also demonstrated that a human P450 enzyme exhibits a novel activity in the conversion of (R)-reticuline to the morphinan alkaloid salutaridine.

Building synthetic feedback control systems may yield insight into the roles that feedback can play in regulation since it can be introduced independently of native regulation, and alternative control architectures can be compared. We propose a model for microbial biofuel production where a synthetic control system is used to increase cell viability and biofuel yields. Although microbes can be engineered to produce biofuels, the fuels are often toxic to cell growth, creating a negative feedback loop that limits biofuel production. These toxic effects may be mitigated by expressing efflux pumps that export biofuel from the cell. We developed a model for cell growth and biofuel production and used it to compare several genetic control strategies for their ability to improve biofuel yields. We show that controlling efflux pump expression directly with a biofuel-responsive promoter is a straightforward way of improving biofuel production. In addition, a feed forward loop controller is shown to be versatile at dealing with uncertainty in biofuel production rates.},

Here we describe an engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells. Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate. The synchronized genetic clock sets the stage for the use of microbes in the creation of a macroscopic biosensor with an oscillatory output. Furthermore, it provides a specific model system for the generation of a mechanistic description of emergent coordinated behaviour at the colony level.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Evolvability is an intrinsic feature of all living cells. However, newly emerging, evolved features can be undesirable when genetic circuits, designed and fabricated by rational, synthetic biological approaches, are installed in the cell. Streamlined-genome E. coli MDS42 is free of mutation-generating IS elements, and can serve as a host with reduced evolutionary potential. RESULTS: We analyze an extreme case of toxic plasmid clone instability, and show that random host IS element hopping, causing inactivation of the toxic cloned sequences, followed by automatic selection of the fast-growing mutants, can prevent the maintenance of a clone developed for vaccine production. Analyzing the molecular details, we identify a hydrophobic protein as the toxic byproduct of the clone, and show that IS elements spontaneously landing in the cloned fragment relieve the cell from the stress by blocking transcription of the toxic gene. Bioinformatics analysis of sequence reads from early shotgun genome sequencing projects, where clone libraries were constructed and maintained in E. coli, suggests that such IS-mediated inactivation of ectopic genes inhibiting the growth of the E. coli cloning host might happen more frequently than generally anticipated, leading to genomic instability and selection of altered clones. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed genetic adaptation of clean-genome, IS-free MDS42 host improves maintenance of unstable genetic constructs, and is suggested to be beneficial in both laboratory and industrial settings.},

abstract = {LINE-1 (L1) elements are retrotransposons that comprise large fractions of mammalian genomes. Transcription through L1 open reading frames is inefficient owing to an elongation defect, inhibiting the robust expression of L1 RNA and proteins, the substrate and enzyme(s) for retrotransposition. This elongation defect probably controls L1 transposition frequency in mammalian cells. Here we report bypassing this transcriptional defect by synthesizing the open reading frames of L1 from synthetic oligonucleotides, altering 24\% of the nucleic acid sequence without changing the amino acid sequence. Such resynthesis led to greatly enhanced steady-state L1 RNA and protein levels. Remarkably, when the synthetic open reading frames were substituted for the wild-type open reading frames in an established retrotransposition assay, transposition levels increased more than 200-fold. This indicates that there are probably no large, rigidly conserved cis-acting nucleic acid sequences required for retrotransposition within L1 coding regions. These synthetic retrotransposons are also the most highly active L1 elements known so far and have potential as practical tools for manipulating mammalian genomes.},

Two amino acid mutations that cause a switch in receptor binding preference from the human alpha-2,6 to the avian alpha-2,3 sialic acid resulted in a virus incapable of respiratory droplet transmission between ferrets but that maintained its lethality and replication efficiency in the upper respiratory tract. Furthermore, poor transmission of a 1918 virus with dual alpha-2,6 and alpha-2,3 specificity suggests that a predominant human alpha-2,6 sialic acid binding preference is essential for optimal transmission of this pandemic virus. These findings confirm an essential role of hemagglutinin receptor specificity for the transmission of influenza viruses among mammals.},

abstract = {The heat-shock protein Hsp90 supports diverse but specific signal transducers and lies at the interface of several developmental pathways. We report here that when Drosophila Hsp90 is mutant or pharmacologically impaired, phenotypic variation affecting nearly any adult structure is produced, with specific variants depending on the genetic background and occurring both in laboratory strains and in wild populations. Multiple, previously silent, genetic determinants produced these variants and, when enriched by selection, they rapidly became independent of the Hsp90 mutation. Therefore, widespread variation affecting morphogenic pathways exists in nature, but is usually silent; Hsp90 buffers this variation, allowing it to accumulate under neutral conditions. When Hsp90 buffering is compromised, for example by temperature, cryptic variants are expressed and selection can lead to the continued expression of these traits, even when Hsp90 function is restored. This provides a plausible mechanism for promoting evolutionary change in otherwise entrenched developmental processes.},

abstract = {Edge detection is a signal processing algorithm common in artificial intelligence and image recognition programs. We have constructed a genetically encoded edge detection algorithm that programs an isogenic community of E. coli to sense an image of light, communicate to identify the light-dark edges, and visually present the result of the computation. The algorithm is implemented using multiple genetic circuits. An engineered light sensor enables cells to distinguish between light and dark regions. In the dark, cells produce a diffusible chemical signal that diffuses into light regions. Genetic logic gates are used so that only cells that sense light and the diffusible signal produce a positive output. A mathematical model constructed from first principles and parameterized with experimental measurements of the component circuits predicts the performance of the complete program. Quantitatively accurate models will facilitate the engineering of more complex biological behaviors and inform bottom-up studies of natural genetic regulatory networks.},

abstract = {Inducible expression systems in which T7 RNA polymerase transcribes coding sequences cloned under control of a T7lac promoter efficiently produce a wide variety of proteins in Escherichia coli. Investigation of factors that affect stability, growth, and induction of T7 expression strains in shaking vessels led to the recognition that sporadic, unintended induction of expression in complex media, previously reported by others, is almost certainly caused by small amounts of lactose. Glucose prevents induction by lactose by well-studied mechanisms. Amino acids also inhibit induction by lactose during log-phase growth, and high rates of aeration inhibit induction at low lactose concentrations. These observations, and metabolic balancing of pH, allowed development of reliable non-inducing and auto-inducing media in which batch cultures grow to high densities. Expression strains grown to saturation in non-inducing media retain plasmid and remain fully viable for weeks in the refrigerator, making it easy to prepare many freezer stocks in parallel and use working stocks for an extended period. Auto-induction allows efficient screening of many clones in parallel for expression and solubility, as cultures have only to be inoculated and grown to saturation, and yields of target protein are typically several-fold higher than obtained by conventional IPTG induction. Auto-inducing media have been developed for labeling proteins with selenomethionine, 15N or 13C, and for production of target proteins by arabinose induction of T7 RNA polymerase from the pBAD promoter in BL21-AI. Selenomethionine labeling was equally efficient in the commonly used methionine auxotroph B834(DE3) (found to be metE) or the prototroph BL21(DE3).},

However, the construction of gene networks with predictable functions remains hampered by a lack of suitable components and the fact that assembled networks often require extensive, iterative retrofitting to work as intended. Here we present an approach that couples libraries of diversified components (synthesized with randomized nonessential sequence) with in silico modeling to guide predictable gene network construction without the need for post hoc tweaking. We demonstrate our approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by synthesizing regulatory promoter libraries and using them to construct feed-forward loop networks with different predicted input-output characteristics. We then expand our method to produce a synthetic gene network acting as a predictable timer, modifiable by component choice. We use this network to control the timing of yeast sedimentation, illustrating how the plug-and-play nature of our design can be readily applied to biotechnology.},

abstract = {Here, we describe assembly PCR as a method for the synthesis of long DNA sequences from large numbers of oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos). The method, which is derived from DNA shuffling [Stemmer, Nature 370 (1994a) 389-391], does not rely on DNA ligase but instead relies on DNA polymerase to build increasingly longer DNA fragments during the assembly process. A 1.1-kb fragment containing the TEM-1 beta-lactamase-encoding gene (bla) was assembled in a single reaction from a total of 56 oligos, each 40 nucleotides (nt) in length. The synthetic gene was PCR amplified and cloned in a vector containing the tetracycline-resistance gene (TcR) as the sole selectable marker. Without relying on ampicillin (Ap) selection, 76\% of the TcR colonies were ApR, making this approach a general method for the rapid and cost-effective synthesis of any gene. We tested the range of assembly PCR by synthesizing, in a single reaction vessel containing 134 oligos, a high-molecular-mass multimeric form of a 2.7-kb plasmid containing the bla gene, the alpha-fragment of the lacZ gene and the pUC origin of replication. Digestion with a unique restriction enzyme, followed by ligation and transformation in Escherichia coli, yielded the correct plasmid. Assembly PCR is well suited for several in vitro mutagenesis strategies.},

To investigate how, we engineered a synthetic library of 154 genes that varied randomly at synonymous sites, but all encoded the same green fluorescent protein (GFP). When expressed in Escherichia coli, GFP protein levels varied 250-fold across the library. GFP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, mRNA degradation patterns, and bacterial growth rates also varied, but codon bias did not correlate with gene expression. Rather, the stability of mRNA folding near the ribosomal binding site explained more than half the variation in protein levels. In our analysis, mRNA folding and associated rates of translation initiation play a predominant role in shaping expression levels of individual genes, whereas codon bias influences global translation efficiency and cellular fitness.},

To circumvent the need for trial and error optimization, we developed a predictive method for designing synthetic ribosome binding sites, enabling a rational control over the protein expression level. Experimental validation of >100 predictions in Escherichia coli showed that the method is accurate to within a factor of 2.3 over a range of 100,000-fold. The design method also correctly predicted that reusing identical ribosome binding site sequences in different genetic contexts can result in different protein expression levels. We demonstrate the method's utility by rationally optimizing protein expression to connect a genetic sensor to a synthetic circuit. The proposed forward engineering approach should accelerate the construction and systematic optimization of large genetic systems.},

However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch-a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network-in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.},

abstract = {The breadth of genomic diversity found among organisms in nature allows populations to adapt to diverse environments. However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales. Although in vitro and directed evolution methods have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties.},

abstract = {The precise establishment of gene expression patterns is a crucial step in development. Formation of a sharp boundary between high and low spatial expression domains requires a genetic mechanism that exhibits sensitivity, yet is robust to fluctuations, a demand that may not be easily achieved by morphogens alone. Recently, it has been demonstrated that small RNAs (and, in particular, microRNAs) play many roles in embryonic development. Whereas some RNAs are essential for embryogenesis, others are limited to fine-tuning a predetermined gene expression pattern. Here, we explore the possibility that small RNAs participate in sharpening a gene expression profile that was crudely established by a morphogen. To this end, we study a model in which small RNAs interact with a target gene and diffusively move from cell to cell. Though diffusion generally smoothens spatial expression patterns, we find that intercellular mobility of small RNAs is actually critical in sharpening the interface between target expression domains in a robust manner. This sharpening occurs as small RNAs diffuse into regions of low mRNA expression and eliminate target molecules therein, but cannot affect regions of high mRNA levels. We discuss the applicability of our results, as examples, to the case of leaf polarity establishment in maize and Hox patterning in the early Drosophila embryo. Our findings point out the functional significance of some mechanistic properties, such as mobility of small RNAs and the irreversibility of their interactions. These properties are yet to be established directly for most classes of small RNAs. An indirect yet simple experimental test of the proposed mechanism is suggested in some detail.},

With the Vibrio fischeri lux quorum sensing circuit, the hypoxia-responsive fdhF promoter, or the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter, the bacteria invade cells at densities greater than 10(8)bacteria/ml, after growth in an anaerobic growth chamber or in the presence of 0.02\% arabinose, respectively. In the process, we developed a technique to tune the linkage between a sensor and output gene using ribosome binding site libraries and genetic selection.

@article{Arkin1998,
abstract = {Fluctuations in rates of gene expression can produce highly erratic time patterns of protein production in individual cells and wide diversity in instantaneous protein concentrations across cell populations. When two independently produced regulatory proteins acting at low cellular concentrations competitively control a switch point in a pathway, stochastic variations in their concentrations can produce probabilistic pathway selection, so that an initially homogeneous cell population partitions into distinct phenotypic subpopulations. Many pathogenic organisms, for example, use this mechanism to randomly switch surface features to evade host responses. This coupling between molecular-level fluctuations and macroscopic phenotype selection is analyzed using the phage lambda lysis-lysogeny decision circuit as a model system. The fraction of infected cells selecting the lysogenic pathway at different phage:cell ratios, predicted using a molecular-level stochastic kinetic model of the genetic regulatory circuit, is consistent with experimental observations. The kinetic model of the decision circuit uses the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, stochastic mechanisms of gene expression, and a statistical-thermodynamic model of promoter regulation. Conventional deterministic kinetics cannot be used to predict statistics of regulatory systems that produce probabilistic outcomes. Rather, a stochastic kinetic analysis must be used to predict statistics of regulatory outcomes for such stochastically regulated systems.},

With the recent availability of the complete 1918 influenza virus coding sequence, we used reverse genetics to generate an influenza virus bearing all eight gene segments of the pandemic virus to study the properties associated with its extraordinary virulence. In stark contrast to contemporary human influenza H1N1 viruses, the 1918 pandemic virus had the ability to replicate in the absence of trypsin, caused death in mice and embryonated chicken eggs, and displayed a high-growth phenotype in human bronchial epithelial cells. Moreover, the coordinated expression of the 1918 virus genes most certainly confers the unique high-virulence phenotype observed with this pandemic virus.},

abstract = {Human Endogenous Retroviruses are expected to be the remnants of ancestral infections of primates by active retroviruses that have thereafter been transmitted in a Mendelian fashion. Here, we derived in silico the sequence of the putative ancestral "progenitor" element of one of the most recently amplified family - the HERV-K family - and constructed it. This element, Phoenix, produces viral particles that disclose all of the structural and functional properties of a bona-fide retrovirus, can infect mammalian, including human, cells, and integrate with the exact signature of the presently found endogenous HERV-K progeny. We also show that this element amplifies via an extracellular pathway involving reinfection, at variance with the non-LTR-retrotransposons (LINEs, SINEs) or LTR-retrotransposons, thus recapitulating ex vivo the molecular events responsible for its dissemination in the host genomes. We also show that in vitro recombinations among present-day human HERV-K (also known as ERVK) loci can similarly generate functional HERV-K elements, indicating that human cells still have the potential to produce infectious retroviruses.},

The part of repressor required for activation was identified in part by the isolation of mutants specifically impaired in transcriptional activation. The amino acids of repressor altered in these "positive control" mutants lie in an acidic patch on the surface of repressor that is closely apposed to RNA polymerase. In this study, we show that this "activating patch" of repressor is sufficient for transcriptional activation in another sequence context. We transfer this activating patch onto the surface of lambda Cro, a protein normally unable to activate transcription, and show that the modified Cro is a transcriptional activator. In addition, we provide evidence that the repressor protein of phage 434 also activates transcription using an activating patch similar to that of lambda repressor.},

abstract = {Methyl halides are used as agricultural fumigants and are precursor molecules that can be catalytically converted to chemicals and fuels. Plants and microorganisms naturally produce methyl halides, but these organisms produce very low yields or are not amenable to industrial production. A single methyl halide transferase (MHT) enzyme transfers the methyl group from the ubiquitous metabolite S-adenoyl methionine (SAM) to a halide ion. Using a synthetic metagenomic approach, we chemically synthesized all 89 putative MHT genes from plants, fungi, bacteria, and unidentified organisms present in the NCBI sequence database. The set was screened in Escherichia coli to identify the rates of CH(3)Cl, CH(3)Br, and CH(3)I production, with 56\% of the library active on chloride, 85\% on bromide, and 69\% on iodide. Expression of the highest activity MHT and subsequent engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in productivity of 190 mg/L-h from glucose and sucrose. Using a symbiotic co-culture of the engineered yeast and the cellulolytic bacterium Actinotalea fermentans, we are able to achieve methyl halide production from unprocessed switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), corn stover, sugar cane bagasse, and poplar (Populus sp.). These results demonstrate the potential of producing methyl halides from non-food agricultural resources.},

Large unilamellar vesicles containing extracts are produced in an oil-extract emulsion. To form a bilayer the vesicles are transferred into a feeding solution that contains ribonucleotides and amino acids. Transcription-translation of plasmid genes is isolated in the vesicles. Whereas in bulk solution expression of enhanced GFP stops after 2 h, inside the vesicle permeability of the membrane to the feeding solution prolongs the expression for up to 5 h. To solve the energy and material limitations and increase the capacity of the reactor, the alpha-hemolysin pore protein from Staphylococcus aureus is expressed inside the vesicle to create a selective permeability for nutrients. The reactor can then sustain expression for up to 4 days with a protein production of 30 muM after 4 days. Oxygen diffusion and osmotic pressure are critical parameters to maintain expression and avoid vesicle burst.},

abstract = {Scientific and technological advances that enable the tuning of integrated regulatory components to match network and system requirements are critical to reliably control the function of biological systems. RNA provides a promising building block for the construction of tunable regulatory components based on its rich regulatory capacity and our current understanding of the sequence-function relationship. One prominent example of RNA-based regulatory components is riboswitches, genetic elements that mediate ligand control of gene expression through diverse regulatory mechanisms. While characterization of natural and synthetic riboswitches has revealed that riboswitch function can be modulated through sequence alteration, no quantitative frameworks exist to investigate or guide riboswitch tuning. Here, we combined mathematical modeling and experimental approaches to investigate the relationship between riboswitch function and performance. Model results demonstrated that the competition between reversible and irreversible rate constants dictates performance for different regulatory mechanisms. We also found that practical system restrictions, such as an upper limit on ligand concentration, can significantly alter the requirements for riboswitch performance, necessitating alternative tuning strategies. Previous experimental data for natural and synthetic riboswitches as well as experiments conducted in this work support model predictions. From our results, we developed a set of general design principles for synthetic riboswitches. Our results also provide a foundation from which to investigate how natural riboswitches are tuned to meet systems-level regulatory demands.},

Two previously identified RNase E sites were placed separately between the coding regions to direct cleavage in this area and produce two secondary transcripts, each containing a single-gene coding region. Novel secondary structures were engineered into the 3' and 5' ends of each of the coding regions to protect the transcript from inactivation by endoribonucleases (5' hairpins) and degradation by exoribonucleases (3' hairpins). In addition, the effects of relative gene placement were examined by switching the locations of the two coding regions. Depending on the particular secondary structures and RNase E sites placed between the genes the relative steady-state transcript and protein levels encoded by the two reporter genes could be changed up to 2.5-fold and 4-fold, respectively. By changing gene location and incorporating secondary structures and RNase E sites the relative steady-state transcript and protein levels encoded by the two reporter genes could be changed up to 100-fold and 750-fold, respectively.},

abstract = {Synthetic biology promises to be highly innovative in its contribution to scientific understanding. But it offers other sorts of innovation too: in the variety of applications that could result and in the wide range of practitioners who could become involved. But directly corresponding to each of these is a kind of regulatory concern. If the entry barriers are low for a form of scientific practice with dramatic implications then the need for regulatory control over access is great since no one wants unlicensed operators releasing experimental organisms. If there are likely to be extensive opportunities for application within the human body and in the open environment (for energy production or novel forms of bioremediation) then the release and safety-testing implications are potentially enormous. Proponents of synthetic biology have been quick to realise that these challenges call for reviews of the societal and ethical aspects of synthetic biology. This paper shows that the template commonly adopted for such reviews draws on bioethics. It goes on to show that this template is far from ideal, both because of limitations in the way that bioethics has been institutionalized and because of key differences between the regulatory demands on synthetic biology and on bioethics. The paper concludes that broader models of societal and ethical review of synthetic biology are urgently required.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The engineering of many-component, synthetic biological systems is being made easier by the development of collections of reusable, standard biological parts. However, the complexity of biology makes it difficult to predict the extent to which such efforts will succeed. As a first practical example, the Registry of Standard Biological Parts started at MIT now maintains and distributes thousands of BioBrick standard biological parts. However, BioBrick parts are only standardized in terms of how individual parts are physically assembled into multi-component systems, and most parts remain uncharacterized. Standardized tools, techniques, and units of measurement are needed to facilitate the characterization and reuse of parts by independent researchers across many laboratories. RESULTS: We found that the absolute activity of BioBrick promoters varies across experimental conditions and measurement instruments. We choose one promoter (BBa\_J23101) to serve as an in vivo reference standard for promoter activity. We demonstrated that, by measuring the activity of promoters relative to BBa\_J23101, we could reduce variation in reported promoter activity due to differences in test conditions and measurement instruments by \~{}50\%. We defined a Relative Promoter Unit (RPU) in order to report promoter characterization data in compatible units and developed a measurement kit so that researchers might more easily adopt RPU as a standard unit for reporting promoter activity. We distributed a set of test promoters to multiple labs and found good agreement in the reported relative activities of promoters so measured. We also characterized the relative activities of a reference collection of BioBrick promoters in order to further support adoption of RPU-based measurement standards. CONCLUSION: Relative activity measurements based on an in vivoreference standard enables improved measurement of promoter activity given variation in measurement conditions and instruments. These improvements are sufficient to begin to support the measurement of promoter activities across many laboratories. Additional in vivo reference standards for other types of biological functions would seem likely to have similar utility, and could thus improve research on the design, production, and reuse of standard biological parts.},

abstract = {The construction of artificial networks of transcriptional control elements in living cells represents a new frontier for biological engineering. However, biological circuit engineers will have to confront their inability to predict the precise behavior of even the most simple synthetic networks, a serious shortcoming and challenge for the design and construction of more sophisticated genetic circuitry in the future. We propose a combined rational and evolutionary design strategy for constructing genetic regulatory circuits, an approach that allows the engineer to fine-tune the biochemical parameters of the networks experimentally in vivo. By applying directed evolution to genes comprising a simple genetic circuit, we demonstrate that a nonfunctional circuit containing improperly matched components can evolve rapidly into a functional one. In the process, we generated a library of genetic devices with a range of behaviors that can be used to construct more complex circuits.},

Disease control is hampered by the occurrence of multi-drug-resistant strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Synthetic antimalarial drugs and malarial vaccines are currently being developed, but their efficacy against malaria awaits rigorous clinical testing. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide extracted from Artemisia annua L (family Asteraceae; commonly known as sweet wormwood), is highly effective against multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium spp., but is in short supply and unaffordable to most malaria sufferers. Although total synthesis of artemisinin is difficult and costly, the semi-synthesis of artemisinin or any derivative from microbially sourced artemisinic acid, its immediate precursor, could be a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, high-quality and reliable source of artemisinin. Here we report the engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce high titres (up to 100 mg l(-1)) of artemisinic acid using an engineered mevalonate pathway, amorphadiene synthase, and a novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1) from A. annua that performs a three-step oxidation of amorpha-4,11-diene to artemisinic acid. The synthesized artemisinic acid is transported out and retained on the outside of the engineered yeast, meaning that a simple and inexpensive purification process can be used to obtain the desired product. Although the engineered yeast is already capable of producing artemisinic acid at a significantly higher specific productivity than A. annua, yield optimization and industrial scale-up will be required to raise artemisinic acid production to a level high enough to reduce artemisinin combination therapies to significantly below their current prices.},

abstract = {Natural biological systems are selected by evolution to continue to exist and evolve. Evolution likely gives rise to complicated systems that are difficult to understand and manipulate. Here, we redesign the genome of a natural biological system, bacteriophage T7, in order to specify an engineered surrogate that, if viable, would be easier to study and extend. Our initial design goals were to physically separate and enable unique manipulation of primary genetic elements. Implicit in our design are the hypotheses that overlapping genetic elements are, in aggregate, nonessential for T7 viability and that our models for the functions encoded by elements are sufficient. To test our initial design, we replaced the left 11,515 base pairs (bp) of the 39,937 bp wild-type genome with 12,179 bp of engineered DNA. The resulting chimeric genome encodes a viable bacteriophage that appears to maintain key features of the original while being simpler to model and easier to manipulate. The viability of our initial design suggests that the genomes encoding natural biological systems can be systematically redesigned and built anew in service of scientific understanding or human intention.},

We previously reported generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, capable of germline transmission, from mouse somatic cells by transduction of four defined transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate the generation of iPS cells from adult human dermal fibroblasts with the same four factors: Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Human iPS cells were similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, surface antigens, gene expression, epigenetic status of pluripotent cell-specific genes, and telomerase activity. Furthermore, these cells could differentiate into cell types of the three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. These findings demonstrate that iPS cells can be generated from adult human fibroblasts.},

abstract = {The breadth of genomic diversity found among organisms in nature allows populations to adapt to diverse environments. However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales. Although in vitro and directed evolution methods have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties.},

Creation and analysis of synthetic networks, composed of well-characterized genetic elements, provide a framework for theoretical modeling. Here, with the use of a combinatorial method, a library of networks with varying connectivity was generated in Escherichia coli. These networks were composed of genes encoding the transcriptional regulators LacI, TetR, and lambda CI, as well as the corresponding promoters. They displayed phenotypic behaviors resembling binary logical circuits, with two chemical "inputs" and a fluorescent protein "output." Within this simple system, diverse computational functions arose through changes in network connectivity. Combinatorial synthesis provides an alternative approach for studying biological networks, as well as an efficient method for producing diverse phenotypes in vivo.},

abstract = {The precise nature of information flow through a biological network, which is governed by factors such as response sensitivities and noise propagation, greatly affects the operation of biological systems. Quantitative analysis of these properties is often difficult in naturally occurring systems but can be greatly facilitated by studying simple synthetic networks. Here, we report the construction of synthetic transcriptional cascades comprising one, two, and three repression stages. These model systems enable us to analyze sensitivity and noise propagation as a function of network complexity. We demonstrate experimentally steady-state switching behavior that becomes sharper with longer cascades. The regulatory mechanisms that confer this ultrasensitive response both attenuate and amplify phenotypical variations depending on the system's input conditions. Although noise attenuation allows the cascade to act as a low-pass filter by rejecting short-lived perturbations in input conditions, noise amplification results in loss of synchrony among a cell population. The experimental results demonstrating the above network properties correlate well with simulations of a simple mathematical model of the system.},

We use the resulting framework to describe one engineered biological device, a genetically encoded cell-cell communication receiver named BBa\_F2620. The description of the receiver is summarized via a 'datasheet' similar to those widely used in engineering. The process of refinement and characterization leading to the BBa\_F2620 datasheet may serve as a starting template for producing many standardized genetically encoded objects.},

abstract = {Different proteins have different expression levels. It is unclear to what extent these expression levels are optimized to their environment. Evolutionary theories suggest that protein expression levels maximize fitness, but the fitness as a function of protein level has seldom been directly measured. To address this, we studied the lac system of Escherichia coli, which allows the cell to use the sugar lactose for growth. We experimentally measured the growth burden due to production and maintenance of the Lac proteins (cost), as well as the growth advantage (benefit) conferred by the Lac proteins when lactose is present. The fitness function, given by the difference between the benefit and the cost, predicts that for each lactose environment there exists an optimal Lac expression level that maximizes growth rate. We then performed serial dilution evolution experiments at different lactose concentrations. In a few hundred generations, cells evolved to reach the predicted optimal expression levels. Thus, protein expression from the lac operon seems to be a solution of a cost-benefit optimization problem, and can be rapidly tuned by evolution to function optimally in new environments.},

Two previously identified RNase E sites were placed separately between the coding regions to direct cleavage in this area and produce two secondary transcripts, each containing a single-gene coding region. Novel secondary structures were engineered into the 3' and 5' ends of each of the coding regions to protect the transcript from inactivation by endoribonucleases (5' hairpins) and degradation by exoribonucleases (3' hairpins). In addition, the effects of relative gene placement were examined by switching the locations of the two coding regions. Depending on the particular secondary structures and RNase E sites placed between the genes the relative steady-state transcript and protein levels encoded by the two reporter genes could be changed up to 2.5-fold and 4-fold, respectively. By changing gene location and incorporating secondary structures and RNase E sites the relative steady-state transcript and protein levels encoded by the two reporter genes could be changed up to 100-fold and 750-fold, respectively.},
